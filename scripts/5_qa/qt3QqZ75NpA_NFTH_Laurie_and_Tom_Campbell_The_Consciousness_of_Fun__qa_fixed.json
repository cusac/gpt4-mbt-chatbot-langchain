        "questioner": "And  good afternoon. This is news for the heart. It is the last Tuesday of the month. May holy man. It's like it keeps going faster and faster. We are going to take a break, so we won't be back until the fall. So I thought we'd end this season, I guess, with discussing, I don't know, some fun things to do, fun things to do over the summer, fun things to do for ourselves to play and to still be conscious of our consciousness, to grow and evolve and still enjoy life. I know some of it can come from Tom's Park, which is an excellent little book that helps us book audio ebook helps us look at ways for us to use our imagination. Also, we can join in with other people. So there are ways that that can be a lot of fun and maybe we'll start with there, but just have fun. What can we do to play, evolve and have fun while we're still doing the work to grow up? Over to you, Tony.",
        "agent": "Well, let's dive into this topic because it's worth discussing. If you've ever had the pleasure of being around someone with a profound level of consciousness, someone who is deeply spiritual, you'll notice that they don't take themselves too seriously. In fact, they often exhibit childlike behavior. This correlation between spirituality and childlike behavior is quite fascinating. You see, fear is what makes us overly serious. It's fear that not only causes us to be serious when we're upset or angry, but it also makes us take life extremely seriously. Every little detail becomes of utmost importance, and if things don't go as planned, we become upset. And all of this stems from fear. However, when we can reduce our fear, we start to approach life with a big smile. We accept things as they come, whether they are pleasant or challenging. We don't let ourselves get too upset because being upset doesn't contribute to any solutions. It doesn't make things better; it only adds to the negativity that already exists. So, yes, growing up not only enhances our relationships and brings more happiness into our lives, but it also reintroduces fun and a sense of childlike wonder. And when I say childlike, I don't mean immature or foolish. I mean embracing our innate human nature. Children aren't burdened by the concerns of what others think, allowing them to fully explore and experience the world with curiosity and joy."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does embracing a sense of childlike wonder and humor contribute to our overall well-being and help us connect with others on a deeper level?",
        "agent": "But it's not so much childish as it is just human. And children aren't so worried about what people think about how they're acting. They just act because it's just the way they feel. And that's a good thing. We call that childish, that our intellect isn't always kind of the censor. Well, you should be like this, and you should always be like that and stay serious and act like you're in charge or act like you're smart or act like this and that. But if you're just giggling because something's funny, well, you see, that's okay, too. If you're grown up and don't have fear, then you don't really worry at all about what other people think of you and your behavior. You're not trying to impress anyone. And when you're not trying to impress anyone, well, if something catches your fancy and it makes you giggle, then you giggle. You laugh, you have fun, you make wisecracks. And the gurus, who really are very spiritual, you'll see, they play jokes and have fun and laugh and generally have a very good time. And people say, yeah, they're so advanced, they start acting like children. Well, no, they're acting like adults that don't have fear, is what they're acting like. Children really don't have a lot of those fears either until we give them to them later on in life. So you just act natural. So fun is an important part of life. Humor is an important part of life. And we need to see humor in a lot of things. A lot of things that we see sadness in. We need to turn that around and see humor in everyday situations, even in the most challenging ones. It helps us cope, it helps us find joy, and it helps us connect with others on a deeper level. So let's embrace the lighter side of life and find humor in the little things, because laughter truly is the best medicine."

        "questioner": "How can shifting our perspective and finding humor in challenging situations help us cope, find joy, and connect with others on a deeper level?",
        "agent": "I see a lot of things. A lot of things that we see sadness in. However, I believe we need to shift our perspective and find humor in those situations."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right.",
        "agent": "That  happens naturally as you get rid of your fear. So fun is good? Fun is fun. Yes. I think it's a big mistake to, one, take yourself very seriously, too seriously, and two, to really care much what other people think of how you're behaving and how you are. That's not you should be honest. You should be the way you really are. You should be what's the word? Authentic."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yes.",
        "agent": "You  should be authentic. And then you should just try that out on people. And if you being authentic causes a lot of trouble and unhappiness, well, then maybe you need to change the authentic you to something else."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yes.",
        "agent": "So, if I notice that my authentic self is not performing well, that's a clear indication that I need to work on improving myself. On the other hand, if my authentic self is doing just fine, then I should embrace it and let it be. If others perceive me as silly for being true to myself, well, that's their problem, not mine. Sometimes, we tend to place individuals who are on a spiritual journey and have achieved some level of success on a pedestal. We expect them to always be serious and profound. However, life doesn't always work that way. Life can be amusing, and people can be amusing too. Of course, it's important to be mindful of other people's feelings. What you find amusing may not be amusing to them, and it could potentially offend them. So, it's crucial to be aware of that and consider their perspective. You might have to suppress some of your amusement if you think it won't be well-received by others. But that doesn't mean you can't still feel it and enjoy it in your own way. If your life is constantly focused on work and seriousness, always measuring your progress towards a goal, then it's essential to take a step back, unwind, and just be yourself. When you do that, you'll start noticing the delightful things in life. A magnificent sunset, a leisurely walk in the park, or even the simple pleasure of walking barefoot in the mud can bring immense joy because you're fully present and able to appreciate these experiences."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What are some ways you can fully embrace the joy of play during summertime, especially when it comes to engaging with your children?",
        "agent": "When I find myself barefoot in the mud, it's a truly enjoyable experience. There's something about the sensation of mud squishing up between my toes that brings me pure delight. I believe that having fun is important, and summertime provides the perfect opportunity for that. Unlike winters, which are mostly spent indoors, summers are all about being outdoors and embracing the joy of play. So, I encourage everyone to engage in games and activities, especially with their children. Whether your kids are five, six, ten, or fifteen, they are always involved in something and playing games. Instead of merely watching from the sidelines, join in and become an active participant in their games. Get down to their level and play the same games they do. You, your child, and even a teddy bear can all have a blast playing hide and seek together. Don't be afraid to have fun and enjoy your time with your children. It's not just about having fun at your own level; it's about immersing yourself in their world. Life is not meant to be a spectator sport. It's about getting involved and fully embracing every moment. Sometimes, we tend to let life pass us by because we take ourselves too seriously or consider ourselves too important. But if crawling on the floor, bumping our heads with a two-year-old, and making them giggle brings us joy, then why not do it? Playing with young children is not only fun but also incredibly rewarding."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you ensure that you actively participate in the activities your children enjoy, regardless of their age, and why is it important to make that effort?",
        "agent": "I understand that some people may not be interested in that kind of stuff. However, I find it enjoyable and highly fulfilling to engage in activities with my young children or even my teenage children. It's important to make an effort to participate in the things they enjoy."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Or  your grandkids.",
        "agent": "Or  your grandkids."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah,  puppies, all of that.",
        "agent": "Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with my granddaughter. She always claims me as her grandpa and wants me all to herself. We have so much fun together, and her giggles bring me so much joy. It's a challenge for me to keep coming up with creative ways to make her laugh, but it's worth it. The most important thing is to have fun in life. If you're not having fun, then you're taking yourself too seriously. You need to lighten up, relax, and connect with people instead of just watching from the sidelines. Even if you're not good at something, like I am, just get involved and have a good time. In fact, it can be even more fun for everyone if you're not very good at it. People will laugh, and you'll all have a great time. So go ahead and engage in fun and frivolous activities just to celebrate being alive and enjoying the sunshine and fresh air. Just walking outside in the early morning when everything smells so fresh and there's a sense of stillness... it's a moment to appreciate and take a deep breath."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you find joy and have fun in the little moments of stillness and appreciate the world around you?",
        "agent": "I've had moments where I haven't encountered any traffic for ten or 12 hours. It's during those times that I take a deep breath and truly appreciate the stillness. It's amazing how much fun you can have just by embracing those moments and enjoying them. There are countless opportunities every day to look at the world around you, appreciate the place you live in, and simply have fun with it. It's incredible how a change in perspective can transform things that used to upset you into things that no longer bother you. You just have to accept them for what they are and stop taking yourself so seriously. When the little things don't go as planned, it's often better to laugh than to cry. Finding humor in those situations can help you realize how unnecessary it was to get so worked up over something that ultimately led to a disaster. Instead of getting angry and frustrated, you can look at it and say, 'Wow, that's actually pretty funny.' It makes you wonder why you went through all that trouble when a different perspective could have made everything work out so much better. And then, you can laugh at yourself for getting so caught up in your own ego. It's an attitude that I believe everyone should adopt. Having fun and feeling gratitude go hand in hand. We've talked about gratitude before, and it's often the first step towards experiencing true joy. So, if you're grateful for having healthy grandchildren, don't just watch them from a distance and think, 'Oh, that's nice, I have grandkids.' Get down on your knees and play with them. Do the things they do, immerse yourself in their world, and let the joy and gratitude intertwine to create unforgettable memories."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do you actively engage with the world around you and find joy in the little moments? What are some ways you connect with your loved ones and embrace life?",
        "agent": "Well, that's nice. It's always a joy to spend time with my grandkids. I make sure to get down on my knees and play with them, doing the things they enjoy. I also take the time to connect with my pets, whether it's playing with my doggies or cuddling with my cat. It's important to get involved and be a part of life, rather than just passively observing it like watching a TV program from your couch. To truly embrace life, you need to plug in and engage with the world around you. Remember, things don't have to be perfect for you to appreciate them. Focus on the good parts and ignore the rest. And here's a fun idea: try to give out as many compliments as you can in a day. It's amazing to see people's faces light up when they receive a random act of kindness. These little gestures don't cost much, just your attention and willingness to connect. That's the key. Everything else tends to fall into place. Oh, and let me tell you, fun is contagious! When you're surrounded by people who are having a great time, you can't help but join in on the fun. I remember when my wife Pamela and I were in England a couple of months ago. After a day full of activities, the group gathered in a large room, connected someone's cell phone to the sound system, and started playing music. It was such a lively atmosphere, with everyone dancing and enjoying themselves. Pamela and I surprised a lot of people when we joined in on the dancing, adding to the energy and excitement of the moment."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What are some activities that you find enjoyable and bring you a sense of fun and fulfillment? How do you embrace the joy of dancing and find pleasure in the simple act of moving to music?",
        "agent": "I had a great time. Many people were surprised when we got up and started dancing. Dancing is enjoyable because it's just motion. You can have fun dancing even by yourself, without a partner. All you need is some music to move to, and that's fun. Don't worry about what others think; you can do it in your own room if you're concerned. But in general, seeing someone having a good time will make others smile. Even if they tease you a little, it's still fun because you can have a laugh at their expense. They're stuck being serious adults while you're enjoying life. Summer is a great time to start, but you can have fun all year round. So yes, having fun is important. By the way, your walking has become fun, hasn't it? It wasn't easy when you started; it required focus, concentration, and pushing yourself each day. But even though it was challenging, it was still fun. It's satisfying when you improve your time by two minutes and feel good about it. Your muscles are developing, your balance is improving, and your walk is smoother and more efficient. All these things are just enjoyable experiences."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you infuse playfulness and a sense of fun into your everyday life, regardless of the challenges you may face? What are some strategies you can adopt to embrace a playful mindset and find joy in the journey?",
        "agent": "As I continue to improve, my walk becomes smoother and more efficient. It's fascinating to witness these changes. Even though I walk the same route every time, there are always interesting sights to see. The dogs, cats, ducks, and other people add an element of fun to my walks. I don't have to make a conscious decision to go somewhere and have fun; I can simply infuse playfulness into my everyday life. Life itself can be a continuous stream of play. Adopting this attitude allows me to enjoy the journey instead of forcing my way through it. Rather than approaching life as a battle, I choose to play with it and have fun. If life presents challenges, I step aside and let them pass. It's all about changing my mindset. Fun is not just for childhood; it's an essential part of growing up. Unfortunately, as we get older, we tend to take ourselves too seriously. We are taught to have performance anxiety from a young age. We learn to fear making mistakes and being laughed at. These early lessons shape our lives, and we develop strategies to avoid embarrassment, such as staying silent and never volunteering. However, it's important to remember that life is meant to be enjoyed, and incorporating playfulness into our daily lives can bring us joy and fulfillment."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What is one approach you have found effective in avoiding potential embarrassment and ridicule, even if it limits your experiences and prevents you from fully engaging with life?",
        "agent": "The best way to avoid being ridiculed is to simply refrain from speaking. I have found that by not volunteering information or expressing my thoughts, I can blend into the background and avoid any potential embarrassment. However, this approach comes with a significant drawback - it limits my experiences and prevents me from fully engaging with life. In order to truly embrace life, I must step out of my comfort zone and actively participate in it. Merely observing from the sidelines and hoping to avoid any unwanted attention or tasks that I may not feel capable of accomplishing is not a fulfilling way to live. It is merely a performance driven by insecurities and a fear of not being good enough."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right?  I guess that's where all the public speaking fears come from, isn't it? I mean, I never even thought about it, but that's exactly what it is.",
        "agent": "Sure."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Wow.",
        "agent": "That's  what people are afraid of. Yeah, they're afraid that all those people out there will find them wanting. Find them not good enough. Find that they didn't do a very good job, that they messed up, that they said the wrong word or pronounced something wrong or forgot their lines or whatever it is. That's just performance anxiety. A fear of being inadequate and not doing it well."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "And  because you were at some point in your life, humiliated from speaking, oh, sure. Right.",
        "agent": "That's the very first lesson I learned in school. And that lesson just keeps being drilled into me throughout my education. I have to perform, and it's crucial to get it right in the correct manner and form. Making mistakes can make me the subject of ridicule, which is a serious problem. The root of this issue lies in the fact that people can be manipulated through their fears. If someone knows my fears, they can easily manipulate me. Teachers want their students to put in more effort, complete their homework, and study the lessons. To motivate the students, teachers often create situations that instill fear in them. For example, students will do their homework because they don't want to look foolish in front of their classmates. Although we call it motivation, it's essentially manipulation. We manipulate children to do things that we believe are good for them. Parents also manipulate their children to get them to do certain things. With young children, manipulation is sometimes necessary to guide them towards positive behaviors and teach them important life skills."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In what situations is it acceptable to distract children as a means of manipulation, and how does this differ from using fear as a manipulative tool in other aspects of life?",
        "agent": "When it comes to manipulating children, sometimes you have to distract them. For example, if your child starts crying because their teddy bear's eyeball fell out, you can hold them, comfort them, and then show them a fun toy to take their mind off the problem. This kind of distraction is not a bad thing because it's not using fear to manipulate. It's just a positive way to shift their focus from something upsetting to something more enjoyable. However, using fear to manipulate people is always a bad thing, regardless of your intentions. Unfortunately, fear is a commonly used tool in various aspects of life. Bosses may use fear to motivate employees by threatening layoffs if production doesn't improve. Coaches, politicians, preachers, and even the legal system often rely on fear to manipulate people because it's an effective method. Fear is so powerful that it can even make people afraid of public speaking. We know that fear can be a strong motivator, but it is important to consider the long-term effects and ethical implications of using fear as a tactic to manipulate or control others."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can confidence help in overcoming fear and anxiety, particularly in situations like public speaking? Can you explain the relationship between confidence and fear, and how building confidence can mitigate the fear of making mistakes?",
        "agent": "Well, why are most people afraid of getting up and talking in front of an audience? We know they're right up here with fear and performance anxiety and getting it wrong and being humiliated. The opposite of that or the antidote for it is confidence. Once you have confidence, then that confidence doesn't come from knowing you are perfect. That confidence comes from knowing that you'll do the best you can. And if you make a mistake, that's all right. It's not a big deal. So you don't mind making the mistake. And with confidence, you can get up and give that talk. And if you mess up or forget a word or something, well, make a little joke of it and go on. And you don't feel like you want to hide when that happens. Instead, it's just part of life, you see? So confidence is developed by getting rid of fear. So all these things are it all ties together. So we don't have much fun as adults because we have so much fear. Children have a lot of fun because they have little fears until we start pumping them up with fear through schools and churches and other things we get them involved in. We're also very competitive in everything we do. That's another thing. Well, competitiveness is basically a way to manipulate with fear. You don't want to be a loser, do you? You want to be a winner. Well, now it's the fear of being the loser, and then it's the fear of, well, I'm not really good enough to win because there's other people better at that than I am. Therefore, what was me, and I'll overcome that fear by building my confidence and realizing that mistakes are part of life."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can fear and manipulation impact our confidence and desire to participate in various aspects of life, and what strategies can we employ to overcome these challenges?",
        "agent": "I used to think that winning was a difficult task because there were always people who were better than me at it. As a result, I would often find myself stepping back and trying to disappear, just like a child who resorts to little strategies to avoid confrontation. These childhood fears and strategies tend to stick with us even as we grow older. Parents often use fear as a tool to control their children's behavior, threatening them with consequences if they don't comply. However, this approach may not be the most effective way to shape behavior. Instead of resorting to bullying and fear, there are alternative methods to address and encourage positive behavior. Throughout our lives, we encounter various individuals who try to manipulate us for their own reasons, just as we try to manipulate others to achieve our desired outcomes. We find ourselves surrounded by manipulators, from marketers who constantly try to persuade us to buy their products, to people in our personal lives who attempt to influence us. This constant manipulation can wear down our confidence and make us feel like we don't want to participate anymore. It's as if we want to escape from this never-ending cycle, seeking a sense of freedom and autonomy."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the fear of making mistakes and the pressure to always get things right impact our confidence and willingness to participate in various aspects of life, and what can we do to overcome these challenges?",
        "agent": "Confidence is a crucial aspect of life. When we lack confidence, it can make us feel reluctant to participate and enjoy ourselves. Personally, I find myself wanting to step away from situations that don't bring me joy. It seems like life loses its excitement and becomes less enjoyable. This lack of fun and confidence is often instilled in us from a young age by our culture. We are taught to take everything seriously, fearing that we might make mistakes or do something wrong. This fear can be paralyzing. A common strategy is to avoid playing altogether, thinking that if we don't participate, we can't lose or mess up. Consequently, we end up sitting on the sidelines, detached from life, and feeling unfulfilled. However, it's important to recognize that we have a choice in how we approach life. We can make better choices that prioritize fun and enjoyment. When we allow ourselves to have fun, we not only benefit personally but also spread that joy to others. Fun is contagious and has a positive impact. It's not about acting like a child but rather embracing our humanity without being burdened by fear. Children naturally embody this carefree spirit until they start school and learn to be more serious and focused on getting things right."

    {
        "questioner": "When  you were talking about kids and dogs, it's like, yeah, try and use negative reinforcement on a cat. That works for you. Just never works. You can do it on a dog, you can do it on your kids. You can do it anyway. They just don't like that.",
        "agent": "No,  you can't. Matter of fact, if you get too negative with a cat, you're almost guaranteed they're going to do exactly what it is you don't want them to do."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Or  worse. Much worse.",

        "questioner": "He  likes to laugh or make others laugh.",
        "agent": "Yeah.  Keith is full of first. The first vacation in Europe that we took with Keith while we were doing an event, and we take a little vacation after. By the time Pamela got home, her sides were aching. It was from laughing so much with Keith. She just wasn't used to that much fun, that much laughing. But Keith is hilarious. He's a very funny guy. And some of those people at those word games, they're playing pun games and so on. They're not all native English speakers. Like, Olaf is one of the key players there with them, and his native language is German. But yet he's playing puns in English, and I'm always amazed at that. If you're speaking a foreign language, just to be understood is a good thing, and to do it well is fantastic. But then to get into the subtleties of puns and so on, that's pretty deep competency in a language. So I see that there's people of all sorts of different first languages that are all involved in Keith's word games, and I'm impressed with that."

        "agent": "So let's talk a little bit about Tom's Park then. It's a fun way to develop your intuitive side by taking the imaginative route. Instead of the standard method of meditation to discipline your mind and enter the intuitive state, you can choose the Tom's Park way. By leveraging your imagination, you can immerse yourself in an imaginary space and allow it to unfold naturally, without trying to control it. This approach achieves the same outcome as meditation because it removes the intellect from the equation, allowing you to tap into intuitive space. Through this method, you can access paranormal abilities such as remote viewing, mind-to-mind communication, and extracting information from databases without the need for extensive discipline training. As you practice imagining, you will improve your ability to create and let go of imagination themes. Now, you probably won't achieve mastery overnight, but with consistent practice and dedication, you can significantly enhance your intuitive abilities and unlock new realms of perception."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can Tom's Park help you enhance your imagination and tap into intuitive space? Can you explain the process and the benefits of using this method compared to traditional meditation?",
        "agent": "At imagining, I can start an imagination theme and then let it go. On the first try, it may not be easy, but that's where Tom Spark comes in. He has a lot of fun activities that help you practice your imagination. The more you get involved in the imagination, the more vibrant and multi-dimensional your daydream becomes. It's filled with colors, sights, sounds, and even tastes. There's so much going on that it becomes complex, making it easier for your intellect to let go and just go with the flow. Daydreaming requires a lot of mental bandwidth, and it can tire out your intellect, leading it to quit and let the daydream take over. It's like a gateway to intuitive space. Many people use this method to tap into their paranormal experiences. They start with a simple metaphor, engage their imagination, and effortlessly slip into an intuitive state. However, it's important to note that their entire experience is not imagined. The imagination serves as a starting point. With practice, you can have a daydream that becomes a vivid and immersive experience, where everyone plays their own part. You don't have to play everyone's role. It's a fun way to explore altered states of consciousness and delve into the larger consciousness system. Compared to meditation, this approach is probably more enjoyable and less challenging."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What are some alternative methods to traditional meditation that can provide an enjoyable and immersive experience while exploring the concept of the larger consciousness system?",
        "agent": "In my experience, I've found that the larger consciousness system is a fascinating concept to explore. While there are various approaches to understanding it, I believe that the meditation path can be quite challenging and perhaps not as enjoyable as other methods. However, it may offer a more direct route to gaining insights. Interestingly, many individuals have shared instances where they've daydreamed and noticed how the thoughts and ideas seemed to effortlessly unfold on their own."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right.",
        "agent": "Our  night dreams do that. Things just happen in there. We don't make those up. They just happen. We get a data stream and that stuff happens. Well, that's the way it is with a daydream as well. You get that daydream and as soon as you start to let go, the larger conscious system starts sending you a data stream that's filling in all the parts for all the players. And you're just one player in something going on. And then those tend to be manipulated then by the larger consciousness system. Manipulated, but not through fear, to help you learn something. So daydreams can be very educational."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Educational?  Well, certainly takes you into that intuitive. For me, it's always an intuitive heart space. It's not always for everybody. That's where I go. Which makes imagination and intuition it's usually a very expansive experience for me because it's all about the heart and then everything's perfect. Right. It's like, why are you trying to do something? It's just the way it's meant to be right now. Right. So I try so hard to change everything and it's right where I'm supposed to be.",
        "agent": "Look  at all those problems and realize they're only problems because of your perspective and the way you're looking at them. If you just change that perspective, all the problems would disappear exactly altogether. And then it's like, I'm having a problem. That means there's a lesson here. Oh, good, I'm going to learn this lesson."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right.",
        "agent": "So  then the problems turn into good things. Opportunities to learn a lesson always. And then learning lessons becomes fun. Not so much work, but fun."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Just  like you can get into that perspective. Yes. Right. That's the issue. Getting retrospective. Yeah.",
        "agent": "Just  like walking that 10 miles."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah.",
        "agent": "It  probably wasn't as much fun the first time you walked it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "I  would be bragging myself on my hands and knees if I could walk 10 miles when I started. That would have been pretty impressive. It didn't. Yeah. Had to work up to that. But yeah, even then, no, it's true. But the fun came from people from exactly what you were saying about to me, the water is always so soothing. I mean, it's sometimes very turbulent, but to me, it doesn't matter. It's like I'm walking, I'm in the sun. Not all the time, but especially this winter, apparently. We had the worst winter for darkness in was it 50 what started at 53 years? 57 years. It was like, wow, okay then. Yeah, we had pretty dark we just didn't have a lot of fun. And I think we create our own fun. We have to find our own fun from perspectives and from, I don't know, just enjoying what we do instead of trying to make it something we have to do. No, just enjoy it. Just play.",
        "agent": "And  then there's always that positive feedback because you're out walking and suddenly you can do it better than you did before, and suddenly your muscles aren't aching anymore like they were. It actually feels good. And you notice that and you say, oh, I'm getting better at this. Good."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "I  get anxious now. If I don't go out, it's like there's an anxiety level building. It's like, okay, I need to move, that's all. I just need to move my body. Interesting.",
        "agent": "Well,  if the weather is really bad and you don't want to go out, you can always dance."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "There  you go.",
        "agent": "You  can always dance. There's some music. No matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, if that music plays and I start dancing because it's music you have to move to."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yes,  I know those songs.",
        "agent": "It's  just the way it is. Put some of those songs on and just go move for a certain amount of time, and then that will make that kind of anxiety. I feel like I need to get out and do something."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "And  yet when I see people that are always with their headphones on and their headsets on, and I think you're not even enjoying it because you're just so focused in your head and not enjoying what's around you. So I don't do that when I'm out, just because to me, it's like, I don't know, maybe I can't have too many things influencing me at the same time, but I just enjoy the freedom, I guess, of being out seeing the same people and enjoying everything about it. But yes, I did not start that way.",
        "agent": "Yeah,  well, there is a time and place for most everything. If you're going to be walking out into a natural world, then that would be the time to enjoy the natural world when you can't, or when there's something else going on, then you do something else. You kind of do the things that seem to make sense why you're doing them now. Today you'll see five teenagers sitting around a big table, and every one of them are staring at their and their thumbs are going like this. And to them, that's a social gathering."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In  fact, they're probably texting themselves.",
        "agent": "Texting  each other."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "They've  lost their socializing communication skills. It's all in their thumbs.",
        "agent": "I  see that too. It's just amusing to us, to them."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "It  that's how they have if you part of Tom's Park community, there's like events that you put on so you guys can join each other and talk and share.",
        "agent": "Yeah, we do that. We have a day in the park. I got one coming up in the future. Here's a day in the park where a bunch of people get together and we all go to Tom's Park to discuss things. Sometimes, we talk about issues or things we're working on, trying to figure out how to do, or just sharing stories. It's a time for learning, but also for having fun. We enjoy hearing stories from people who had a great time, and sometimes we dive into more serious topics. We share what happened to us and ask for insights or interpretations. Often, there are metaphors or hidden meanings that we miss, and others can help us see them. These events are fun, lighthearted, and playful. Unlike meditation, which is more serious and focused on discipline, this approach allows us to let go of our intellect and connect more openly. All the information and connections we need are already there; we just need to set our intention and allow it to flow. The challenge is to silence our analytical mind and let our imagination guide us. It's a more enjoyable way to achieve the same goal."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does daydreaming compare to meditation in terms of achieving a similar goal? What are the advantages of daydreaming over meditation?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you, going through the imagination is an incredibly enjoyable way to achieve that. It does require some practice, of course. Initially, not everyone has the innate ability to imagine vividly, but it's definitely a faster process compared to learning how to meditate. Plus, it's a lot more entertaining! You'll find that your imagination takes flight quite effortlessly. On the other hand, becoming a proficient meditator takes years of dedicated practice. If you can simply sit on a bench amidst a bustling crowd and effortlessly enter a deep meditative state, chances are you've been honing your meditation skills for quite some time. However, daydreaming is a different story altogether. You can indulge in a daydream anywhere, at any time, without being affected by the surrounding noise and commotion. It's fascinating how easily you can immerse yourself in a daydream because it's not a task or a skill you're trying to perfect; it's pure enjoyment. It captivates your attention and keeps you engaged. That's precisely what makes daydreaming so much simpler and more enjoyable. And it takes you on a journey, transporting you to a world of endless possibilities and imagination."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Same  space and your mind doesn't know the difference between what you're imagining and what you're doing. So if you're fully in that space, then your mind is also not only free, but it's having fun, right?",
        "agent": "Yes.  And it's learning. And you are learning because when you're in that imaginary space and all the choices that you make, all the interactions and all the choices that you make now, again, this is not you imagining it through your intellect but letting that imagination run free when you get to that point. All those choices and things you do that you make there help you evolve or deevolve if you make poorly. So it becomes another space in which your interactions affect your evolution."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Nice.",
        "agent": "It's  a learning space as well. So this space we call the physical universe, it's a learning space. And everything we do affects other people. And we make good choices, we evolve and bad choices, we evolve. But when you're in your imagination or in a dream, it's the same way that's you making choices. And there are results and consequences to those choices. It's just the consequences in a dream or in an imaginary space are much less constrained. They're much looser. The environment isn't so tied down to the rule set like it is here in this reality. So it gives you things that you could do and choices that you could make that you maybe would never get a chance to here."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Like  flying and visiting.",
        "agent": "Things  you just can't do here very well."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Go  through walls or it even gives.",
        "agent": "You  opportunities to say be nice to people or to abuse people that you wouldn't do here."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right?  Oh, that's true.",
        "agent": "Yeah.  You can go into a dream and take advantage of somebody I really dislike that person. They did this and that. And then you have this dream where you go and you take advantage of them and you embarrass them or hurt them or kill them or whatever else. You're making those choices."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right.",
        "agent": "And those are all bad choices. You see, everything is more accessible in that space. Things that are not available here become available there. In this physical reality, you would have to consider the potential consequences of your actions, such as being arrested for physically assaulting someone. However, in the realm of daydreams or out-of-body experiences, there are no immediate consequences for your actions. Therefore, it becomes easier to express your true nature, the aspects of yourself that you would never reveal in this reality due to societal constraints. In those imaginary or transcendent spaces, you may engage in behaviors that are considered unpleasant or ugly, but it is important to acknowledge that those behaviors stem from within you. They are a reflection of your true self because, in those spaces, your choices directly represent your core essence. It is crucial to remember that your intellect, which houses your self-image, takes a backseat in those experiences. Your intellect becomes quiet, allowing your true being to emerge. Consequently, the choices you make in dream spaces or intuitive states are a direct reflection of your authentic self, devoid of societal conditioning. It is only when your intellect comes into play that the self-image starts to act as a judge, imposing limitations and restrictions. It may say, 'You can't do that,' 'You shouldn't do that,' 'You will get caught if you do that,' or 'There will be consequences if you engage in those actions.' As a result, you tend to behave in a more polite and socially acceptable manner in this reality, adhering to societal norms and expectations."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In those alternate spaces where you can express your true nature, what kind of activities do you engage in and how do they differ from your behavior in this reality?",
        "agent": "In those other realities, I engage in various activities. Here, in this reality, I tend to exhibit more pleasant behavior and adhere to social norms. However, the true essence of who I am is revealed in those alternate spaces. All the facades and politeness fade away, allowing me to truly meet myself. It is in these spaces that I have the freedom to grow and explore aspects of my personality that are prohibited in this reality due to cultural norms. So, if in my daydreams I express aggression or engage in unsavory actions to seek revenge, it is a reflection of my capabilities. Just because I don't display such behavior here doesn't mean it is not a part of who I am. These alternate spaces serve as invaluable learning environments. They not only offer different types of learning experiences but also provide opportunities for authentic self-expression. By embracing these spaces, my personal growth and evolution are accelerated. It is a space where I can truly be myself and learn in ways that are not possible here. And most importantly, it should be enjoyable as I embark on this journey of self-discovery. Well, it seems we have reached the end of an hour."

        "questioner": "I  know, can you believe it?",
        "agent": "Yeah,  just talking about having fun. And it's been fun, hasn't it?"
    },
    {
        "questioner": "There  you go. Got a little serious at the end there, but true. Interesting opportunity to see our authentic self when we think about when we get angry or upset and what we think about at that time, never have I thought about death or killing somebody, but certainly I've thought just, I don't know, seeing my anger, but yeah, it's brought some interesting points up, but yeah, well, we do that.",
        "agent": "We  imagine that we're really going to squish somebody or embarrass them or unmask them or somehow create some difficulty for that person. It created difficulty for us, and we're going to get even. And all of that ugliness is in there. That's the authentic. You being ugly and self centered and not really caring about people, just caring about yourself. And sure enough, that's all in there. When you think thoughts like that, and it's good to get in those spaces and see that, because you'll learn an awful lot about who the authentic you is when you get into the out of body spaces or into these daydream spaces where the dream goes on by itself. It's the real you then. And that real you is often surprising to people, oh, no, I'm a nice person, and I'm kind and gentle and caring for all the people, but I'm going to smash them and I'm going to do this tear them to pieces. Well, that nice guy is an image, not necessarily a reality. Yeah, but we're here to have fun. But it's all fun, and particularly, you look back on it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah.  You laugh at yourself then.",
        "agent": "Yeah.  It's like you crawling on your hands and knees for that 10th mile. But now you look back at it and you say, yeah, that was fun. You look at yourself and say, well, I'm glad I kept after it. I was learning. And it wasn't fun at the time, but it becomes fun in retrospect. They were good times. And, you know, we do that. We look back on times where we were very busy or very engaged or very whatever, and when we were in that, we were thinking, oh, I need a break. I need a vacation. I got to get off this treadmill. And we look back at it later, and mostly people say, those were some of the best times in my life, because I was so engaged and so connected with things that I didn't have time just to engage my self centeredness. I didn't have time. And then you look back and you see that those were good times, because you weren't engaging your self centeredness, because you just didn't have the time for that kind of petty stuff. You were just too busy or whatever, and they turn out to be really good times in retrospect, even if they were very busy and hectic times when you were in them. There's a lot of fun going on. We just don't see it, and we just don't let ourselves get involved in it. We stay off on the sideline and watch it or maybe imagine it. That's okay. So anyway, we've done it. This has been a fun program. All about fun."
