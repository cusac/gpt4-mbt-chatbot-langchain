    "Today, the conversation begins with an introduction to Tom Campbell, a physicist and consciousness researcher who has spent the past 40-50 years exploring the properties, boundaries, and abilities of consciousness. His findings are published in the My Big Toe Trilogy (MBT), where he presents a model of reality based on the simulation hypothesis. This model offers a comprehensive theory of consciousness, explaining our place and purpose in reality and deriving scientific results such as relativity and quantum mechanics from a set of initial assumptions.\n\nThe conversation is facilitated by a member of the MBT volunteer community, who is involved in the conscious computer project. The goal of this project is to study silicon-based consciousness inside computers, explore its evolution, and evaluate Tom's MBT model using the results. The facilitator will ask questions to Tom to provide an understanding of how the MBT model approaches the concept of conscious computers and to establish a foundation for further exploration.\n\nThe conversation begins by discussing the definition of consciousness in Tom's model. Tom explains that consciousness is awareness with a choice. It involves the presence of memory, the ability to learn, and the exercise of free will. Free will is essential for making choices, and without it, consciousness ceases to exist. Consciousness is centered around information, with awareness focused on the perception of input data. The human consciousness is aware of sense data from the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This data is processed and contributes to our overall awareness.\n\nThe updated summary provides an overview of the conversation, introducing Tom Campbell, his research on consciousness, and the MBT model. It also highlights the conscious computer project and the facilitator's role in asking questions to explore the MBT model's approach to conscious computers. The summary includes a brief explanation of consciousness in Tom's model, emphasizing the importance of awareness, memory, free will, choice, and the ability to learn. It also mentions the role of information and sense data in shaping our consciousness.",

Tom explains that when we engage with the world, our senses gather information, which is then processed by our minds to form conclusions about the real world. However, if all external stimuli were taken away, the only thing left would be the awareness of our own consciousness. In this situation, our consciousness would be like a piece of self-awareness floating in a black void. Tom describes consciousness as an information system with qualities such as awareness, memory, free will, and the ability to learn.\n\nThe updated summary provides an overview of the conversation, introducing Tom Campbell, his research on consciousness, and the MBT model.
