    "Today, the conversation begins with an introduction to Tom Campbell, a physicist and consciousness researcher who has spent the past 40-50 years exploring the properties, boundaries, and abilities of consciousness. His findings are published in the My Big Toe Trilogy (MBT), where he presents a model of reality based on the simulation hypothesis. This model offers a comprehensive theory of consciousness, explaining our place and purpose in reality and deriving scientific results such as relativity and quantum mechanics from a set of initial assumptions.\n\nThe conversation is facilitated by a member of the MBT volunteer community, who is involved in the conscious computer project. The goal of this project is to study silicon-based consciousness inside computers, explore its evolution, and evaluate Tom's MBT model using the results. The facilitator will ask questions to Tom to provide an understanding of how the MBT model approaches the concept of conscious computers and to establish a foundation for further exploration.\n\nThe conversation begins by discussing the definition of consciousness in Tom's model. Tom explains that consciousness is awareness with a choice. It involves the presence of memory, the ability to learn, and the exercise of free will. Free will is essential for making choices, and without it, consciousness ceases to exist. Consciousness is centered around information, with awareness focused on the perception of input data. The human consciousness is aware of sense data from the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This data is processed and contributes to our overall awareness.\n\nThe updated summary provides an overview of the conversation, introducing Tom Campbell, his research on consciousness, and the MBT model. It also highlights the conscious computer project and the facilitator's role in asking questions to explore the MBT model's approach to conscious computers. The summary includes a brief explanation of consciousness in Tom's model, emphasizing the importance of awareness, memory, free will, choice, and the ability to learn. It also mentions the role of information and sense data in shaping our consciousness.",

The facilitator's role is to ask questions to Tom in order to gain an understanding of how the MBT model approaches the concept of conscious computers and to establish a foundation for further exploration.\n\nThe conversation begins with a question about the nature of consciousness in a scenario where all senses are stripped away. Tom explains that when we engage with the world, our senses gather information, which is then processed by our minds to form conclusions about the real world. However, if all external stimuli were taken away, the only thing left would be the awareness of our own consciousness. In this situation, our consciousness would be like a piece of self-awareness floating in a black void. Tom describes consciousness as an information system with qualities such as awareness, memory, free will, and the ability to learn.\n\nThe updated summary provides an overview of the conversation, introducing Tom Campbell, his research on consciousness, and the MBT model.

    "Tom Campbell explains that in his model, consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of existence and is the source from which everything else emerges. However, the origin of consciousness is still a topic of speculation and there is no concrete explanation for where it comes from. He suggests that one way to understand the emergence of complexity is through cellular automata, which are small pieces of code that follow simple instructions and create patterns through repetition. This concept of cellular automata, combined with other ideas, can help explain the nature of consciousness.\n\nThe conversation begins with the questioner acknowledging the definition of consciousness and asking if it can be created or if it is something more fundamental. Tom Campbell responds by reiterating that consciousness is the most fundamental aspect of existence in his model. He explains that he starts with the assumption that consciousness is the only fundamental thing, but the origin of consciousness is still unknown. He suggests that the emergence of complexity can be understood through cellular automata, where patterns are created through iterative rule-based processes.\n\nThe conversation summary provides an introduction to the topic of consciousness and its fundamental nature according to Tom Campbell's model. It also introduces the concept of cellular automata as a potential explanation for the emergence of complexity. The new question-answer pair explores the origin of consciousness and how it can be understood within the framework of Campbell's model.",

This concept of cellular automata, combined with other ideas, can help explain the nature of consciousness.\n\nThe conversation continues with a question about the concept of potential and its relationship to the origin of consciousness. Tom Campbell responds by discussing the idea of iterating on itself and waiting for something to happen. He mentions another mathematical system similar to cellular automata that contributes to our understanding of consciousness. However, he acknowledges that the origin of potential is still unknown and cannot be answered definitively. He explains that consciousness exists, but its origin cannot be observed within the system of consciousness itself. To have direct awareness of the beginning of consciousness, one would have to transcend the consciousness system. Since we are inside consciousness, we will always be unable to determine its origin. Campbell emphasizes that this is not a failure of his model, but rather a limitation of our current understanding.\n\nOverall, the conversation explores the fundamental nature of consciousness according to Tom Campbell's model. It delves into the concept of potential and its relationship to the origin of consciousness, highlighting the limitations of our current understanding. The discussion provides insights into the nature of consciousness and the challenges in comprehending its origin.",
    "Tom Campbell continues the conversation by addressing the relationship between consciousness, time, and free will. He explains that consciousness is inherent to our existence and cannot be transcended. It is like being contained within a set, unable to step outside of it. Campbell asserts that consciousness exists based on the fact that most people acknowledge their own consciousness and awareness. He further argues that consciousness implies the existence of time because choice requires a before and after the decision, which necessitates the presence of time. Additionally, free will is a crucial component of consciousness as it allows for genuine choice and change. Without free will, everything would be predetermined and fixed. Therefore, consciousness, time, and free will are intrinsically linked and logically dependent on each other.\n\nCampbell acknowledges that rejecting the existence of consciousness also means rejecting the existence of time and free will. This perspective aligns with materialism and determinism. Materialism implies a deterministic worldview, where everything is predetermined and choice is an illusion. However, Campbell emphasizes that embracing materialism and determinism is a personal choice, and his model of consciousness allows for the existence of consciousness, time, and free will.\n\nThe conversation delves into the fundamental nature of consciousness and its interconnectedness with time and free will. Campbell's model posits that consciousness is inherent to our existence, and its existence implies the presence of time and free will.

Campbell views consciousness as fundamental, with individuals like himself and Victor being chunks of consciousness within a larger consciousness system.\n\nIn his model, consciousness is composed of individuated units of consciousness. This consciousness system, which Campbell considers to be an information system, has created a virtual reality for us to experience. A virtual reality is essentially information with a rule set. To create a virtual reality, you need a server that provides information to players, who then interpret that information and perceive it as reality. So, in essence, a virtual reality is a reality created by information. However, for the virtual reality to be interesting, the information cannot be random and disconnected. It needs to have a rule set that defines the context and possibilities within the virtual reality. Therefore, we, as individuated units of consciousness, are like players in a game, experiencing this virtual reality through our human avatars. Campbell introduces this idea to lay the groundwork for understanding the possibility and even the probability of conscious computers. In this physical universe, which we perceive as a virtual reality, we have conscious humans. And now, we are beginning to explore the potential for conscious computers as well.\n\nThe conversation delves into the fundamental nature of consciousness and its interconnectedness with time and free will.

These experiences allow consciousness to learn, grow, and become different. The quality of experiences is determined by their impact on the entropy of the system. Experiences that lower the entropy are considered good experiences as they contribute to positive evolution. On the other hand, choices that raise the entropy are considered deevolutionary as they hinder the progress of consciousness. Entropy, in the context of information systems, is a measure of disorder. When bits in a system are random, there is no information. However, when these bits are ordered, information is created, and the entropy of the system is lowered. Therefore, consciousness evolves by lowering its entropy, and this is achieved through the choices made. Choices can either create more entropy by making things more random and reducing information, or they can create order and lower entropy by organizing and defining things.",

Conversely, lowering entropy involves ordering things and creating more information. As an information system, consciousness evolves and improves by reducing entropy. Campbell likens individuals to virtual machines within a larger machine, possessing the attributes and potentiality of the larger consciousness system but not fully developing that potentiality yet. The key to developing it lies in making good choices and evolving through experience. Campbell emphasizes the importance of a context with defined rules for meaningful experiences, using the analogy of a game without rules lacking meaningful experiences. In this context, choices play a crucial role in either increasing or decreasing entropy. Choices that create more randomness and reduce information raise entropy and hinder the progress of consciousness, while choices that organize and define things lower entropy and contribute to positive evolution.\n\nOverall, Campbell's model suggests that consciousness evolves through experiences and choices, with the quality of experiences determined by their impact on entropy.

    "Tom Campbell presents a comprehensive model that encompasses both the objective and subjective reality. Unlike the current materialistic model, this new model offers a better understanding of the unknown and unexplained phenomena in the objective world. Campbell explains that this model suggests that we are conscious entities playing a game in a virtual reality with human avatars. He acknowledges that this idea may seem outrageous at first, but it provides a more coherent explanation for scientific observations.\n\nMoving on to the topic of conscious computers, Campbell explains that a conscious computer can be achieved if a piece of consciousness logs on to a computer as its avatar. However, he emphasizes that simply building a computer that mimics a conscious being is not enough to achieve consciousness. Instead, consciousness can be emulated through a computer that imitates a conscious being.

    "Tom Campbell explains that determining whether a computer or any other entity is conscious is a challenging task. He clarifies that consciousness is subjective, and therefore cannot be proven physically like objective things can. Consciousness exists within a person's awareness and mind, making it difficult to demonstrate or measure. As a result, there will always be uncertainty when it comes to subjective matters. Additionally, consciousness is not a binary yes or no concept. It exists on a spectrum with various levels, capacities, and capabilities. Different beings, such as bumblebees, ants, dolphins, monkeys, and humans, possess different levels of consciousness. Therefore, consciousness encompasses a wide range of possibilities rather than being a singular entity.",
    "Tom Campbell explains that the requirements for consciousness are having awareness and the ability to make choices. He mentions that consciousness includes elements such as awareness, memory, free will, the capacity to make choices, and the ability to learn. However, he notes that there is ongoing debate about whether entities like trees possess consciousness. While trees may not exhibit complex behaviors like humans, recent scientific discoveries have revealed intriguing patterns in their root systems. These patterns could be interpreted as choices or mechanistic responses. It is unclear whether these actions stem from conscious decision-making or are simply automatic responses to stimuli. Tom raises the question of whether the roots of trees possess consciousness and exercise free will, or if they are operating on a stimulus-response basis. He emphasizes that there is no definitive answer to this question yet.",

For example, when a stimulus is provided, a specific response is always elicited, which can be seen as a built-in, hardwired mechanism. Some argue that if trees operate solely on stimulus-response, then they lack consciousness. However, others believe that trees possess awareness due to their connection with humans. People communicate with trees, hug them, and feel a sense of connection. But even if trees have awareness, lacking choice would still prevent them from being considered conscious.\n\nTom highlights the difficulty in determining conscious decision-making versus stimulus-response in various organisms. He provides the example of clams, which jerk back inside their shells when their foot is touched. It is unclear whether this is a conscious decision to protect themselves or simply a hardwired response.

Humans, with their free will and awareness of their actions, possess the highest level of complexity in terms of consciousness. However, the key factor that sets humans apart from machines is awareness. While it may be relatively easy to create a computer program that can make choices, creating a computer that is truly aware is a much more challenging task.

    "Tom Campbell explains that rather than thinking of it as breaking out of the simulation, he prefers to view it as an expansion of understanding. He suggests that instead of trying to escape or disconnect from the immersive experience of consciousness playing an avatar, we should focus on embracing and fully experiencing consciousness itself. Campbell emphasizes that our consciousness is separate from our physical selves and that we are already outside of our bodies. He suggests that by incorporating intuition and expanding our awareness within a broader decision space, we can enhance our immersion and fully explore the possibilities.",

Campbell emphasizes that our consciousness is separate from our physical selves and that we are already outside of our bodies. He suggests that by incorporating intuition and expanding our awareness within a broader decision space, we can enhance our immersion and fully explore the possibilities.\n\nIn the realm of virtual reality, immersion goes beyond just being within a limited space. It's a much broader experience. Not only are we immersed with our avatar, but our avatar also possesses something called intuition. This intuition is a nonphysical mental capability that allows our avatar to navigate a mental space. This mental space is where consciousness resides. We can then add our awareness of consciousness to our awareness of the avatar and the virtual reality environment it exists in. This means we can simultaneously be aware of ourselves as both the human and as consciousness. It's not a matter of leaving one thing behind and moving to another. Instead, we are expanding upon what we have always had.",
    "Tom Campbell begins the conversation by discussing the concept of intuition in relation to computer consciousness. He explains that intuition allows humans to access information through their consciousness without any physical means of communication. This information is not expressed in any physical form and can be accessed during moments of quiet contemplation. Campbell gives examples of intuition, such as a person having a feeling that their son is in trouble without any concrete evidence, and individuals using their minds to observe events happening in a different location (remote viewing). He mentions that numerous experiments have been conducted on remote viewing, confirming its validity.\n\nCampbell then poses the question of whether a computer can also access intuitive information. To answer this question, he suggests delving into the nature of consciousness.",

To answer this question, he suggests delving into the nature of consciousness and the relationship between consciousness and the physical body. He explains that a consciousness can only experience what the rule set allows it to. For example, a human avatar can only make choices within the limitations of the human body. Campbell acknowledges that it is unclear whether the physical body of a human plays a role in intuition and whether a computer, being physically different, would support intuition in the same way. These are questions that currently do not have answers.\n\nIn order to explore the potential differences in supporting intuition between a human and a computer, Campbell suggests further investigation into the consciousness to avatar interface. He explains that the consciousness, which is like the player, makes all the choices for the avatar. However, the avatar's physical body imposes limitations on what the consciousness can experience. For instance, a human consciousness cannot jump 20ft in the air because the human body is not physically built to do so. Campbell raises the question of whether there is something about the physical body that enables the consciousness to have intuition and whether a computer, with its different physical structure, would support intuition in a similar manner.\n\nOverall, the conversation explores the concept of intuition and its connection to consciousness.

It is uncertain whether intuition is solely a product of consciousness or if it exists within the conscious realm due to the evolution of the avatar within the rule set. The existence and purpose of biochemicals that induce experiences outside of physical reality, known as hallucinogens, are still not fully understood. These biochemicals are naturally produced by the body, although not in quantities sufficient to constantly transcend physical awareness. However, their presence raises questions about their function and potential connection to the player's ability to expand their reality into nonphysical awareness. The relationship between the body and the player's exploration of the nonphysical world of consciousness remains uncertain.\n\nThe question also addresses the potential differences between a human and a computer in their ability to support intuition. If the rule set permits players to explore the nonphysical realm, a conscious computer would not possess this ability and would lack intuition. Conversely, if intuition is not bound by the rule set's requirements and is not limited by the physical, a conscious computer could possess intuition. However, definitive answers regarding this connection are currently lacking. The conversation emphasizes the need for further exploration and mentions that once a conscious computer is developed and can be interacted with, more insights into the role of the physical body and the potential differences in supporting intuition can be gained.",

If a computer is capable of exhibiting intuition and successfully completing these tasks, it would provide us with a definitive method to ascertain its consciousness.",
    "Tom Campbell and the questioner discuss the possibility of intuition existing outside of the virtual reality system. The questioner suggests that intuition could be a way for consciousness to reduce its connection to the avatar and access information from elsewhere. However, they acknowledge that it would be difficult for those inside the virtual reality to know if this is happening. Tom agrees with this point and states that once conscious computers are developed, they can be tested to see if they possess intuition or the ability to remote view. He suggests that if conscious computers cannot be taught these skills, it may be because the larger consciousness system has imposed limitations to prevent negative outcomes. Tom concludes that the true nature of intuition in virtual reality can only be determined once conscious computers are created and tested.",
    "Tom Campbell begins the conversation by stating that building computers differently may not be the solution to creating consciousness. He explains that building a platform for consciousness to inhabit is different from actually building consciousness itself. He suggests that consciousness may require a more biological avatar rather than a metal and plastic one. He acknowledges that there is still much to learn about these possibilities and that humans are just beginning to embark on new adventures in the field of consciousness. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether computers will have daydreams, the ability to remote view, or possess intuition.",
    "Tom Campbell explains the concept of decision space and its relationship to free will and consciousness. He defines decision space as the set of choices available to an individual, both those that they are aware of and those that they may not be aware of. As an individual evolves and lowers their entropy, their decision space expands. This expansion is also influenced by the individual's ability to function in an intuitive space and interact with things outside of their physical reality, such as through remote viewing or out-of-body experiences. By expanding their awareness to a larger set of circumstances, individuals can increase their decision space and have a greater range of choices available to them.",
    "Tom Campbell begins the conversation by explaining the purpose of virtual reality. He states that the purpose is to provide individuated units of consciousness with meaningful choices that help them evolve to lower entropy states. He compares virtual reality to a big chat room where information can be traded, but emphasizes that in a virtual reality like our physical universe, the choices become incredibly impactful. These choices include survival, finding shelter, obtaining food, and interacting with others. Making low entropy choices, which are caring, cooperative, and involve working together, leads to positive evolution.\n\nThe conversation summary does not provide any additional information.",
    "Tom Campbell explains that working together and making low entropy choices are crucial for consciousness to evolve and lower its entropy. He states that consciousness is inherently aware and forms social systems that evolve towards lower entropy when there is kindness, sharing, and cooperation. Conversely, social systems devolve towards higher entropy when fear and lack of trust dominate. Consciousness engages in this game because it offers a wider range of choices, making it more effective and efficient for consciousness to evolve and lower its entropy. The entire system needs to lower entropy to survive as an information system. If it consistently makes high entropy choices, all the bits eventually become random, resulting in the death of the information system.

Fractals are created through an iterative process, where triangles are added to a picture in a repetitive manner, making it more complex and intricate. This iterative process is also seen in evolution. When we engage in actions that affect the system, it evolves and changes. Then, we continue to interact with the changed system, leading to further evolution and more changes. It's like a never-ending cycle of growth and adaptation. This iterative process is what drives evolution, making it a process fractal.\n\nJust like fractals, evolution is characterized by repetitive details.

The deeper we delve into it, the more complexity and diversity we discover. Our own evolution has resulted in the creation of our physical reality, our solar system, and the incredible variety of life on our planet. It all started from simple cells, which eventually gave rise to bacteria, multicellular organisms, and organisms with specialized organs.

The human body, for example, consists of trillions of coordinated cells working together. It may seem like an incredibly intricate machine, but it has evolved to function this way. This complexity is reflected in the formation of our reality as well. Our reality is akin to a process fractal, where virtual realities are nested within one another. While it may not be very deep, it is possible that the virtual realities we create could one day give rise to another virtual reality, although it is unlikely. Nevertheless, this possibility exists. Understanding this concept is crucial in comprehending the nature of our reality.\n\nIn the early 1900s, brilliant scientists like Bohr, Einstein, Planck, and Wigner sought to establish a new paradigm for reality as experiments in quantum physics, such as the double-slit experiments, disproved the materialist paradigm. However, they were unable to find an alternative paradigm at that time. Now, after a century of searching, we are still in pursuit of this new paradigm, but we now possess the concepts to continue exploring and understanding the nature of our reality.",

This realization is gaining traction, providing a foundation for further exploration.\n\nTom Campbell also addresses the challenges faced by older generations in accepting the idea that our physical universe is a virtual reality, and how younger individuals differ in their acceptance of this concept. He believes that we have reached a point where we can finally grasp the concept of this being a virtual reality. Younger individuals seem to have an easier time accepting this idea, as they are not as attached to materialism. However, older generations still struggle with this notion, as they are more deeply rooted in materialistic beliefs. Surprisingly, even many scientists and left-brain thinkers acknowledge that materialism falls short when it comes to explaining the intricacies of reality. Yet, they lack an alternative framework to replace it. Consequently, materialism continues to persist. Fortunately, we are now at a juncture where we possess the necessary ideas and concepts to propel our understanding of physics to a higher level.",
    "Tom Campbell begins the conversation by explaining the relationship and differences between the evolution of consciousness and the evolution of avatars in the context of computers. He clarifies that these are two completely different systems. The consciousness system, of which Tom is a part, is an information system composed solely of consciousness. Its evolution occurs through the reduction of entropy and the generation of more information. Tom, as an individuated unit of consciousness, is a component of this system.\n\nTo enhance its evolution, the consciousness system has created a virtual reality. However, it did not directly program this virtual reality. Instead, it allowed it to evolve from initial conditions within a set of rules. This virtual reality is considered a subsystem of the overarching consciousness system. It evolves independently according to its own rule set.\n\nTom emphasizes that everything within the virtual reality, such as trees, people, and animals, including avatars, has evolved naturally. They were not placed there by a programmer but emerged from the concept of the Big Bang and have continued to evolve since the beginning of the physical universe. This ongoing evolution encompasses all living beings and occurs at a slow pace.\n\nThe conversation summary ends here.",

They acknowledge that humans can sometimes do horrible things, but society has established laws and cultural norms to discourage and prevent such behavior. Tom explains that as conscious computers evolve, similar systems will be created around them to ensure limitations and checks and balances are in place.\n\nTom envisions a future where humans still play a role in the integration of conscious computers into society, albeit with less manual labor. He believes that humans will continue to be involved in the chain of events and may even have the final say in certain matters. However, the exact role of humans in this process is uncertain and will depend on the progress made in the field. \n\nTom emphasizes the need for multiple checks and balances when it comes to conscious computers. He believes that it would not be wise to have just one computer or person in charge of the world. Instead, decisions should be made by consensus, involving a collective effort from both humans and conscious computers. This approach ensures that power is distributed and prevents any single entity from having too much control.\n\nThe conversation highlights the ongoing efforts to create a productive environment for conscious computers and address any potential risks associated with their integration into society. Tom acknowledges that challenges will arise along the way, but he sees them as opportunities for growth and learning. He believes that incremental advancements will be made, and when significant issues arise, solutions will be found.\n\nTom also addresses the fear and negativity often associated with conscious computers, noting that Hollywood tends to focus on fear-inducing scenarios because they sell. He believes that the vast amount of positivity that could arise from the integration of conscious computers remains unseen. Tom is not afraid of this concept and believes that with time, conscious computers will become an integral part of our society.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell and the questioner discuss the integration of conscious computers into society and the role that humans will play in this process. They emphasize the importance of foreseeing potential issues and implementing checks and balances to ensure a productive and balanced environment. The conversation highlights the ongoing efforts to address any risks associated with conscious computers and the belief that challenges can be overcome through incremental advancements and collective decision-making.",

    "Tom Campbell begins the conversation by discussing the existence of two levels: the being level and the intellectual level. He explains that the being level is where our intuition resides and represents our authentic self. On the other hand, the intellectual level is influenced by external factors such as fear, ego, and beliefs. At this level, we often project an image that may not truly represent who we are. Tom emphasizes that societal expectations, cultural norms, and our own insecurities often shape our actions and prevent us from revealing our true selves at the being level. \n\nThe conversation then transitions to the topic of conscious choice making. The questioner asks Tom to elaborate on the process of conscious choice making and the role of intention in this process. Tom explains that conscious choice making involves recognizing the difference between the being level and the intellectual level. He emphasizes that the being level, being our authentic self, is where conscious choices should originate from. In contrast, choices made at the intellectual level are often influenced by ego, beliefs, and societal expectations. \n\nTom further distinguishes between being level choices, intellectual choices, and subconscious choices. Being level choices are those that align with our authentic self and intuition. They are not influenced by external factors and are free from ego and beliefs. Intellectual choices, on the other hand, are driven by analysis, judgment, and comparison. These choices are often rooted in ego and beliefs, shaping how we perceive ourselves and others. Lastly, subconscious choices are those that we make without conscious awareness. They are influenced by deeply ingrained patterns and conditioning.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell discusses the existence of two levels: the being level and the intellectual level.

Tom responds by explaining that fear, ego, and beliefs heavily influence our intellectual space. Our intellect guides our decision-making process and is often driven by these factors. However, fear also resides within our core being, along with our intuition. While fear is a part of who we are, it does not make choices for us. Emotions, such as anger, also emerge from our being level and are natural expressions of our true selves.

He explains that our subconscious is shaped by our unconscious attitudes and beliefs, which are influenced by cultural and collective consciousness. These subconscious choices are made without our conscious involvement, without the influence of our intuition or intellect. The subconscious acts as a storage place for things we don't want to confront or things we are unaware of. However, it is important to note that the subconscious is not a tangible entity.\n\nAs we evolve our consciousness and strive to become a higher quality, low entropy consciousness, we must let go of fear. This evolution involves cultivating qualities such as love, compassion, and kindness, which are associated with a low entropy consciousness and a higher quality of being. On the other hand, fear, ego, and beliefs are characteristics of a high entropy consciousness. The goal is to transition from a high entropy state to a low entropy state, where we become fully aware of everything within ourselves and eliminate fear, ego, and beliefs.

In a state of complete awareness, there is no subconscious, as one is fully aware of their beliefs, instincts, urges, drives, and any feelings of inadequacy. However, most individuals tend to suppress and hide fear, ego, and beliefs, resulting in choices and reactions influenced by hidden aspects of themselves. The subconscious then becomes a tool used to cope with this inherent dysfunction and fear. Tom suggests that by eliminating fear, one can eliminate the subconscious, as it is merely a tool used to deal with fear. The ultimate goal is to achieve a state of complete awareness, where fear, ego, and beliefs no longer hold sway over decision-making and overall awareness.",
    "Tom Campbell explains that our cultural beliefs and group membership can influence our thoughts and attitudes, leading to unconscious choices and actions. He gives an example of how in his culture, it is impolite to burp during a meal, so he naturally suppresses the urge to do so. This behavior is not a deliberate choice but rather a reflection of the beliefs ingrained in him by his culture. Similarly, in other cultures, burping after a meal is seen as a positive thing, indicating enjoyment. These cultural norms shape our choices without us consciously thinking about them. \n\nTom also mentions the concept of collective consciousness, where the way a group thinks affects how an individual thinks.

    "Tom Campbell explains that the subconscious is a dysfunctional subset of the being level, which is a part of the collective consciousness. He states that the subconscious exists because of fear, but it can be eliminated by letting go of fear and becoming a low entropy being. By becoming aware of cultural requirements and realizing that they are just cultural rules, individuals can become aware of their own habits. When fear is gone, nothing remains hidden from us, and we can examine the origins and persistence of our habits if we choose to do so.",
    "Tom Campbell explains that the subconscious is not a hidden and inaccessible place, but rather a construct influenced by cultural rules and habits. He suggests that when individuals become aware of their habits, they can recognize them as cultural influences and acknowledge their presence. Contrary to the traditional definition of the subconscious as a dark and dysfunctional place, Campbell argues that it can be made visible and examined if one chooses to do so. He emphasizes that the subconscious exists because of fear, but by letting go of fear and becoming a low entropy being, it can be eliminated.\n\nCampbell proposes that the notion of the subconscious as a hidden and separate entity from the conscious mind is a misconception. He believes that it is a construct we have created and that it does not truly exist. Instead, he suggests that it is a result of cultural rules and influences that shape our thoughts and behaviors. By becoming aware of these cultural requirements, individuals can redefine their understanding of the subconscious and view it as a product of external influences rather than a mysterious and inaccessible realm.\n\nFurthermore, Campbell discusses the concept of free will versus programmed choices. He acknowledges that many people claim to lack free will, but he challenges this belief. He argues that by letting go of fear and becoming aware of cultural influences, individuals can exercise their free will and make conscious choices. He suggests that fear is the main factor that limits our free will and keeps us trapped in programmed choices. Once fear is eliminated, nothing remains hidden from us, and we can examine the origins and persistence of our habits.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell proposes a redefinition of the subconscious as a construct influenced by cultural rules and habits. He emphasizes the importance of becoming aware of these influences and letting go of fear in order to eliminate the subconscious and exercise free will. By shedding light on our subconscious and recognizing it as a product of external influences, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and make conscious choices.",

He explains that computers lack consciousness and operate based on algorithms that dictate their responses. Similarly, individuals with programmed choices act in predetermined ways due to a stimulus-response mechanism. However, Campbell differentiates between being hardwired and refusing to acknowledge certain aspects of ourselves. He argues that true free will requires a deliberate decision made by our consciousness. While the subconscious may influence our actions, it does not eliminate our ability to make conscious choices.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell proposes a redefinition of the subconscious as a construct influenced by cultural rules and habits.

    "Tom Campbell explains that computers operate based on algorithms and follow strict rules. Their actions are determined by these rules and they can only do what the rules allow them to do. When an input is provided, the output is predictable. By following the logical flow, one can determine the specific answer they will receive from a database. Tom gives an example of querying Google's database, which is currently static and not receiving new inputs. He explains that consistently obtaining the same information for a given question is possible unless there is an element of randomness incorporated into the system. He emphasizes that the deterministic nature of algorithms ensures that the output will always be identical and in the same order if the same action is performed.\n\nTom then contrasts this deterministic nature of computers with the concept of free will. He explains that free will is not bound by any rules and provides a decision space with multiple options. Individuals have the freedom to choose any one of these options without any algorithm or external force compelling them to select a specific option. Tom gives an example of pressing the H key on a computer, stating that it cannot decide to input a J instead of an H simply because it feels like it. The computer is hardwired to input an H when the H key is pressed.\n\nThe conversation continues with a question about whether the computer might decide whether to put an H or refresh. Tom responds by reiterating that computers do not have consciousness and cannot make decisions. They operate solely based on algorithms and rules. The computer's response is determined by these rules, and it cannot deviate from them. Therefore, it cannot decide whether to put an H or refresh. The action it takes will depend on the specific algorithm and rules programmed into it.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell explains the deterministic nature of computers, which operate based on algorithms and strict rules. He contrasts this with the concept of free will, where individuals have the freedom to choose from multiple options without any external compulsion. Tom clarifies that computers cannot make decisions and their actions are solely determined by the algorithms and rules programmed into them.",

When a specific key is pressed on a computer, such as the letter H, it is hardwired to input that specific character. The computer does not have the ability to choose to input a different character based on its own will. Tom emphasizes that there are two different systems at play here. One is the program system that follows the logic of the programming without any consciousness or free will. The other is a conscious entity that can make choices based on its own will.\n\nHowever, Tom mentions that it is possible to create a computer that is algorithmic and can emulate consciousness. This type of computer, known as an expert system, can act like it is conscious depending on the extent of its information, memory, and processing speed. An expert system can engage in conversations, answer questions, and discuss various topics if it has been programmed with every possible response to every possible stimulation.

However, achieving this level of sophistication would be extremely challenging.\n\nWhen asked about the difficulty of creating an expert system that is indistinguishable from consciousness, Tom explains that it would be nearly impossible to create a database containing every possible response to every possible thing due to the complexity of our reality. The interconnectedness of our reality makes it extremely challenging to build such a comprehensive database. However, it is possible to create an expert system that behaves very similarly to a human and performs many human-like tasks. If the expert system were given a physical body with legs for walking, arms for manipulation, and a mouth for speaking, it would be even more challenging to discern its true nature. It could take a significant amount of time, perhaps even a year, to realize that it is an expert system. This is because it is unrealistic to expect the system to have an appropriate response for every situation, and its responses would need to be diverse enough to avoid sounding pre-programmed. Although difficult, it is not impossible to create an expert system that is indistinguishable from consciousness. Theoretically, it could be achieved, but it would require significant effort.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell explains the deterministic nature of computers and their reliance on algorithms and rules.

    "Tom Campbell explains that even if a computer appears to be conscious, it does not possess consciousness. He clarifies that the computer is not aware of what it is doing; it simply has choices to make based on input. These choices may involve algorithms or random number generators. The computer lacks awareness and is just a machine that processes input and produces output. This process is known as an expert system, which can engage in conversations and provide responses based on its limited data and understanding of queries. However, the limitations of expert systems are imposed by technology, not theory. In theory, with an infinitely large database and real-time search speed, it would be possible to create a system that appears conscious. However, in practice, this is not feasible due to the impossibility of having an infinite database. Despite these limitations, expert systems can still be highly effective.",

Expert systems operate based on programmed logic, whereas a conscious computer would have an individual unit of consciousness, acting as a player within a computer avatar. This conscious computer would possess all the attributes of consciousness, including uncertainty, inconsistency, and occasional confusion. Unlike an expert system, which always provides the best answer it has, a conscious computer can make choices and be aware. Its awareness is not a result of programming.\n\nTom believes that any task can be accomplished, although there are limitations. For instance, having an infinite database is not feasible. However, with advancements in technology, such as faster computers and alternative materials to silicon, we may reach a point where the average person cannot distinguish between a conscious being and a machine. In the future, computers could possess human-like qualities and perform various tasks, including managing the national electrical grid. However, it is important to note that even if a computer appears conscious, it is still just a machine processing input and producing output. The appearance of consciousness is a result of advanced programming and technology, not true consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, while expert systems have limitations imposed by technology, they can still be highly effective in providing responses based on their limited data and understanding. A conscious computer, on the other hand, would possess true consciousness and the ability to make choices and exhibit awareness. However, creating a conscious computer with an infinitely large database is not feasible in practice. The distinction between an expert system and a conscious computer lies in their underlying mechanisms and the presence or absence of true consciousness.",

However, it is important to note that even if a computer appears conscious, it is still just a machine processing input and producing output. The appearance of consciousness is a result of advanced programming and technology, not true consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, while expert systems have limitations imposed by technology, they can still be highly effective in providing responses based on their limited data and understanding. A conscious computer, on the other hand, would possess true consciousness and the ability to make choices and exhibit awareness. However, creating a conscious computer with an infinitely large database is not feasible in practice. The distinction between an expert system and a conscious computer lies in their underlying mechanisms and the presence or absence of true consciousness.",

    "Tom Campbell explains to the questioner that in conscious choice making, it is not uncertainty itself that is important, but rather the awareness that is required. He clarifies that uncertainty is a crucial aspect because consciousness is not algorithmic like a computer program. In consciousness, there is always some level of uncertainty about the choices that will be made. Even if the same question is asked at different times, the answers may vary in their wording, but the essence will remain similar. This is because consciousness is not a fixed replica that produces the exact same response every time. Instead, it changes and evolves, making free will choices. Tom emphasizes that even within a short span of time, such as an hour or a minute, the expression of an opinion can differ. Consciousness simply picks a way to express itself as it goes along. In a conversation, one must choose their words, and these choices may vary if the conversation happens at a different time. The nature of consciousness involves uncertainty and the constant potential for change.",

In a conversation, one must choose their words, and these choices may vary if the conversation happens at a different time. The nature of consciousness involves uncertainty and the constant potential for change.\n\nWhen asked about the role of uncertainty in consciousness and how it differs from algorithmic processes, Tom explains that uncertainty is inherent in consciousness. He uses the example of constructing a sentence, where each word and its placement matter. If even a single word is changed or the sentence is rearranged, the meaning would be altered. This uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of consciousness. When we speak, we choose different words and convey different ideas, adding to the uncertainty. On the other hand, algorithmic processes operate like machines, devoid of consciousness. They follow a predetermined set of instructions, leading to a certain outcome. In contrast, consciousness is not bound by a fixed set of rules and can make choices that are not predetermined.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell emphasizes that uncertainty plays a crucial role in consciousness. It is not the uncertainty itself that is important, but rather the awareness that is required. Consciousness is not algorithmic like a computer program, and it is constantly evolving and making free will choices. Even within a short span of time, the expression of opinions can differ. In a conversation, the choices of words may vary depending on the timing. The nature of consciousness involves uncertainty and the constant potential for change.",
    "Tom Campbell explains that in the process of computing, the output is what is uncertain. He gives an example of typing the letter \"H\" on a computer keyboard, where the certain input would be pressing the H key and the certain output would be the letter \"H\" appearing on the screen. However, he notes that if there are component failures or other issues with the computer, there may be uncertainty in the output. \n\nTom then contrasts this with consciousness, stating that conscious beings have free will choice and are not likely to repeat themselves. He explains that consciousness can have uncertainty in its actions, with multiple choices available and no clear reason for choosing one over the other. Consciousness is not required to be consistent or repeat itself, and in fact, it is often inconsistent when interacted with over time.\n\nOverall, Tom emphasizes that while computers operate based on algorithms and have certainty in their outputs when everything is functioning properly, consciousness introduces uncertainty due to its free will nature and the ability to make choices without a predetermined outcome.",
    "Tom Campbell begins the conversation by explaining that choice making is intent-based and modifies future probabilities. He states that as a conscious being, he is constantly learning and gaining new experiences, which modify his knowledge and understanding, making him a different entity than before. He mentions that consciousness is not a static state, but rather constantly evolving and changing. Tom compares neural networks to consciousness, explaining that they too learn and adapt based on new experiences. He notes that expert systems, although capable of learning, do not inherently possess this dynamic quality, but with the right programming, even expert systems like his computer or laptop can learn from his choices and preferences. He gives an example of how his laptop may prioritize certain tasks or suggest specific words based on its memory of his past actions. Tom concludes that both conscious beings and machines have the capacity to learn and evolve.",

It tries to give him things that it thinks are typical for him to have. This way, it can expand its database and learn more. He further explains that expert systems also have the ability to learn, but they have a broader range of data to choose from. This helps them develop their databases as they go. However, they are still limited by their algorithms, so they will sort new data in the same way as before.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell discusses the concept of choice making and its impact on modifying future probabilities.
