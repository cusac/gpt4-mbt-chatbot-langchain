Bob was searching for scientists to join his lab, and since Tom was a scientist, he volunteered. Under Bob's guidance, Tom learned how to explore the larger consciousness system and navigate it with complete control. As a physicist, Tom's primary goal is to understand how reality functions. Flying around in the larger reality posed a significant challenge for him, leading him to question the limits, possibilities, and the very nature of consciousness itself. It took him around 30 to 35 years to compile his findings into the books he wrote. Throughout this journey, his connection with Monroe lasted for about a decade, with five years of intense activity and several years serving on the board of directors. Tom expresses that his passion for this subject never waned and that once you embark on this path, it becomes impossible to turn back.\n\nOverall, Tom expresses his gratitude, introduces the topic of his talk, provides an overview of what to expect in today's talk on Reality 102, and shares some background on his journey as a physicist and his exploration of the larger consciousness system and the nature of reality.

He explains that chaos in physics refers to the way systems work and move, particularly when pushed into unstable areas. He discusses how natural systems become naturally chaotic and how this concept gained traction in the 1990s. He emphasizes that reality is fundamentally chaotic and not as predictable as previously believed. Tom then connects his understanding of consciousness to chaos theory and its implications for our understanding of reality. He explains that once he realized that our reality is virtual and information-based, everything fell into place. Virtual reality became the crux of his message of love to a larger population. He also mentions the experiment conducted nearly a century ago that revealed the non-materialistic and probabilistic nature of reality, highlighting the role of consciousness. Despite having this information, scientists struggled to interpret and utilize it.",

Tom believes that concrete evidence demonstrating these mind-bending phenomena in the realm of virtual reality with tangible objects would prove that virtual reality is indeed a reality.\n\nIn response to a question about his journey of exploring the concept of virtual reality and its recognition among physicists, Tom explains that he started exploring ways to demonstrate that our reality is a virtual reality based on information and consciousness a couple of years ago when virtual reality was still considered a silly idea by most people. However, in the past 13 years, virtual reality has gained significant recognition, especially in the last five years. Physicists were initially resistant to this idea but eventually embraced it due to the compelling evidence from their own experiments. The younger generation, less attached to traditional perspectives, also acknowledged the possibility of our reality being information-based. However, they lacked a fundamental theory to provide context and make sense of this concept. Now, with the growing support for virtual reality, people are willing to explore the concepts further.\n\nThe conversation continues with Tom delving into the current trends in exploring the idea of our reality being information-based. He explains that there is a growing interest in understanding the fundamental nature of reality and how it relates to consciousness. Scientists and researchers are exploring the concept of our reality being a virtual construct driven by information and consciousness. This shift in perspective has led to new theories and experiments that aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms of our reality. Tom highlights the importance of having a fundamental theory that can explain and make sense of the various phenomena observed in virtual reality and consciousness research.\n\nTom also discusses the younger generation's perspective on the concept of virtual reality. He explains that the younger generation is more open to exploring new ideas and concepts, including the possibility of our reality being information-based. They are less attached to traditional perspectives and more willing to question the nature of reality. However, Tom notes that while the younger generation acknowledges the possibility of virtual reality, they still lack a comprehensive theory to provide a framework for understanding and exploring this concept further.\n\nIn conclusion, Tom Campbell's talk, \"Reality 102,\" explores the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness.

He highlights the importance of ongoing scientific exploration and experimentation in this field.\n\nIn response to a question about the concept of emergent complexity and its relation to the evolution of the larger consciousness system, Tom explains that the assumption of prime mortal consciousness plays a role in this conjecture. He begins by discussing the assumption that prime mortal consciousness exists and has evolved over time. This assumption leads to the conjecture that the larger consciousness system evolves through emergent complexity, which operates on simple, initially random recursive processes. Tom provides an example of cellular automata, a concept that exemplifies emergent complexity. He explains that if a random system has the potential to be more than just random, it will eventually actualize that potential given enough time. Many combinations of elements will occur, leading to the emergence of non-random patterns that can serve as a foundation for further development.\n\nOverall, Tom Campbell's talk delves into the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness.

By continuously repeating this process, remarkable and intricate results can be achieved. Tom compares this process to fractals, which are geometric shapes created by repeatedly adding smaller versions of themselves. In the case of cellular automata, a similar principle is applied, where a process operates in cycles and the output of each cycle becomes the input for the next.

Understanding fractals, emergent complexity, and iterative processes can provide insight into how our world functions and how consciousness may have emerged.\n\nTom explains that consciousness is an information system that processes data, is aware, and perceives. The driving force behind consciousness is the reduction of entropy, and its purpose is to contribute to the overall system by reducing entropy. The virtual reality simulation serves as a training ground for entropy reduction.\n\nTom provides a detailed explanation of the initial conditions and rule set that governed the evolution of the virtual reality simulation. He describes the initial conditions as a tight ball of plasma under high pressure and temperature, which then exploded in the big bang. However, Tom clarifies that the big bang was a simulation, not a physical event. From that point on, the simulation evolved based on the rule set.\n\nIn virtual reality, a computer, a player, and the computation of the virtuality interact to create the virtual world. The computer serves as the rule set, the player interacts with the virtual world, and the computation of the virtuality is the result. The player and the computer engage in constant dialogue, where the computer changes the pixels on the player's screen based on their commands and computes the consequences of those actions.\n\nWhen interacting with a virtual reality environment, the computer calculates the consequences of the player's actions and provides feedback. This constant conversation shapes the virtual reality experience.\n\nIn virtual reality environments, the computer facilitates communication and interaction between the player and the virtual world by existing as consciousness in the same reality. Therefore, in our reality, the computer must also be consciousness. It is an integral part of our experience as conscious beings.\n\nIn conclusion, Tom Campbell's talk explores the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness. He emphasizes the importance of cooperation and care for one another in achieving the lowest entropy state.

    "Tom Campbell's talk, \"Reality 102,\" explores the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness. He emphasizes the importance of involving physicists in the mainstream adoption of virtual reality and plans to present three major experiments challenging materialism. Tom also highlights the need for a fundamental theory to explain phenomena observed in virtual reality and consciousness research.\n\nDuring the conversation, Tom addresses the origin and causality of fundamental aspects of physics such as space, time, and mass. He points out that physics lacks an understanding of where these fundamentals come from and how they relate to each other. According to Tom, this lack of knowledge suggests that physicists may need to reconsider their perspective. He suggests that the unknown nature of these fundamentals is a characteristic of a virtual reality, where the computer simply specifies quantities and attributes.\n\nTom also discusses the concept of an expanding universe and the creation of extra space. He questions how this extra space is made and what the universe expands into. He argues that these questions have no clear answers within the framework of physics. Tom suggests that the expanding universe and the creation of extra space can be understood in the context of a virtual reality simulation. In a virtual reality, space can be defined by specifying an origin, and three-dimensional space expands from there.\n\nOverall, Tom's talk delves into the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness. He emphasizes the need for physicists to be involved in the adoption of virtual reality and presents experiments challenging materialism. Tom also explores the origin and causality of fundamental aspects of physics, highlighting the unknown nature of these fundamentals and their potential connection to a virtual reality simulation.",

Tom also discusses the origin and causality of fundamental aspects of physics, highlighting the unknown nature of these fundamentals and their potential connection to a virtual reality simulation.\n\nDuring the conversation, Tom addresses the questions of how space is defined and expanded within a simulation, as well as the generation of time and the role of concepts like mass, charge, and gravitation within the simulation. He explains that space in a simulation is simply defined by an origin and three-dimensional coordinates represented by orthogonal unit vectors pointing in the X, Y, and Z directions. By assigning larger numbers to the coordinates, the space can be expanded. Tom emphasizes that this process is straightforward and does not require consideration of what the space is expanding into or who is creating it.\n\nRegarding time, Tom explains that it is generated by the outer loop in a simulation. In dynamic simulations, there is always an outer time loop that drives the calculations for everything that changes. After each calculation, time is incremented by a small amount, and the process repeats. This is how our concept of time is created within the simulation.\n\nTom also discusses the role of concepts like mass, charge, and gravitation within a simulation. He explains that these concepts are models that we create to explain observed effects. In simulations, rule sets are created, and relationships between different elements are defined. Tom gives the example of characters in games like The Sims or World of Warcraft being able to measure gravity, observe the passage of time, and understand concepts like mass and space.\n\nOverall, Tom's talk delves into the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness.

By measuring how long it takes for the rock to reach the ground from different heights, the elf could determine the strength of gravity in the game. However, the cause of gravity in the virtual world is simply a programmed rule set and remains invisible to the players. This is a characteristic of virtual realities, where fundamental concepts exist without any explanation. Physicists studying these concepts without clear definitions can't help but see the signs of a virtual reality. In virtual realities, we only experience the effects of phenomena, never the underlying mechanisms. We create stories and explanations to make sense of these effects.\n\nOverall, Tom's talk delves into the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness.

He explains that when we observe the effects of particles like electrons, we often attribute those effects to the existence of the particles themselves. However, we never directly measure the particles. Instead, we measure the consequences or outcomes that result from their presence. The particles themselves remain elusive and intangible. Tom emphasizes that our understanding of particles is based on the models we create to explain their effects. He cautions against believing that these models are an accurate representation of reality, as they can lead us astray when confronted with phenomena that defy our preconceived notions. Tom suggests that electrons, as we imagine them, may not actually exist and may be nothing more than a story we've created.

He suggests that particles are not tangible entities but rather virtual constructs that we use to explain their effects. Tom speculates that humans create these concepts and believe in them because it provides a sense of certainty and security. By attributing everything to particles, we can convince ourselves that our world is grounded in facts and materialism is the ultimate truth. This illusion of understanding alleviates our discomfort with uncertainty. Tom acknowledges that scientists also grapple with this tendency to believe fabrications as absolute truth.

Scientists needed a solid foundation to stand on and provide a sense of certainty and security. However, materialism is not entirely based on facts. It was embraced because there was no better alternative at the time. Tom suggests that if science had not created these beliefs and held onto them, science would be completely different today. The authority of scientists over religion was based on the appearance of having more facts, even though they didn't actually have more.

Physicists still don't fully understand why nothing can travel faster than 'C'. This characteristic alone suggests that we might be living in a virtual reality. Tom points out that all virtual realities have their own speed limits, and 'C' is a constant in ours.

He explains that these fields are mathematical abstractions that help us maintain our belief in materialism. In reality, there is nothing physically transmitting the force between charges. However, within a materialistic framework, we use a rule set that states the force between charges is proportional to their magnitudes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
