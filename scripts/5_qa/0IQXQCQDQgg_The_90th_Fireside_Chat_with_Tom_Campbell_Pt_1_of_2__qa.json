        "questioner": "All  right. Well, without further ado, we can get into our questions now. Tom, you said something, and this really leads in very nicely to one of Ash's questions he posted about playing the cards you've been dealt. Right. His question, I'm not sure if you had the chance to read it was pretty long. But to paraphrase it, he was saying, it seems like some people have it easier than others. Right? They're good looking, they're tall, they're born rich, and some people seem to have some very poor cards dealt to them, whether they have a handicap or they're the wrong color in that particular culture. Now, is it really easier to lower your entropy in either of these situations? He's wondering. It doesn't seem fair to Ash. What would you have to say on that?",
        "agent": "That sense of fairness is my ego, Ash. Yes, I have to deal with what I've got. I have to deal with who I am. Now, if it's things I can easily change, like if I'd rather live in a different neighborhood, well, maybe I can change that. Maybe I can't. If I can't change that because all the other neighborhoods cost too much, well, then I have to realize I'm going to stay where I am or I have to make plans for getting a better job, that sort of thing. So I have to deal with what I have. I'm here to make choices, deal with things. Remember, this is the way life works. Stuff happens and I get to deal with it. That's life. And by the choices, by the way I deal with it, I evolve or deevolve. That's the whole thing. So it's not that some people have it easier than others. Everybody has their own challenges to deal with. I'll have a set of challenges, and if I happen to be born with one arm and one leg, well, then I have a different set of challenges than other people. But I deal with those challenges, I make the best of it. I do what I can do, I develop what I can develop. And the alternative to that is to sit around and feel sorry for myself. And then I don't develop much of anything. So instead of feeling it's not fair, which is kind of feeling sorry for myself, I need to say, here's where I am. Whatever my situation is, what other skills I have, whatever advantages or disadvantages I have now, what am I going to do about it?"
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In life, everyone faces their own unique set of challenges and circumstances. How do you approach the choices and challenges that come your way, regardless of whether you perceive them as advantageous or disadvantageous?",
        "agent": "As I reflect on my skills, advantages, and disadvantages, I contemplate the choices I need to make. In every situation, there are always choices available to evolve the quality of my consciousness. I strive to do my best with the resources I have. Even if I feel like I've been dealt a bad hand, I view it as an opportunity for personal growth. The more challenging the lesson, the greater the potential for learning something significant. Therefore, I embrace the tough challenges I face, as they provide me with the chance to grow exponentially if I handle them well. Instead of seeing my challenges as setbacks, I see them as opportunities for personal development. I ask myself, 'What are my low entropy choices? What are my caring and loving choices? What are my positive choices?' By making these choices and taking action, I can make significant progress. On the other hand, if I were born into wealth and had everything handed to me on a silver platter, it might be a difficult path for personal growth. It would be challenging to find meaningful challenges when everything is readily available. In such a scenario, my main challenge would be to mature and develop despite the abundance of material possessions. The path to personal growth is not always determined by external circumstances, but rather by the choices we make and the challenges we embrace."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do you approach challenges in your life, especially when you have access to abundant resources and privileges? How do you ensure personal growth and make a positive impact despite the comfort and advantages you possess?",
        "agent": "My challenges? Well, my main challenge would be to grow up and face the world despite having all these privileges and resources. Instead of wallowing in comfort, I would challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone and make a difference in someone's life, perhaps by joining the Peace Corps and immersing myself in a jungle somewhere to provide assistance. We all face challenges in life, and it's important to acknowledge them. So, instead of complaining about how unfair life is, it's crucial to take a look around, assess our choices, and start taking action. Dwelling in self-pity will only drain our energy and hinder our ability to achieve our goals. Therefore, it's essential to let go of such negative thoughts and confront our challenges head-on. We should ask ourselves, 'How can I best tackle these challenges in a positive and constructive manner?' and then proceed with determination and resilience."

        "questioner": "I wanted to move next to Dorothea's, I hope I'm saying that right. Dorothea's question. This one is about the rule set, the actual rule set of this virtual reality. And then how much can be bent? How much breaking of the rule set can you do, whether it be from your own personal belief and conviction or the pervading cultural beliefs of the times. And what even does the LCS have to do with it? Does the LCS play a role as well in our little realities rule set? Well, I will ask Dorothea to be a little more specific in the situation because that's such a broad question, it's hard to answer it. I  can understand it. I'll try to describe a little bit better with some examples. Around 1947, a man named Mirin Dajo attracted worldwide attention with a demonstration of how he pierced the fluorette through his body without being seriously injured. According to him, he was absolutely convinced that he could not be hurt. This was his explanation why he wasn't hurt. And there are also numerous reports of children who did not know that body parts do not grow back and so the avatar grew back. Perhaps a finger or something else for example or another example is placebos. Even traditional medicine now recommends that doctors use the placebo effect on patients today. So my question is what is really possible? If I really believe or if I do not know that a finger does not grow back, what would be possible? Or are all these actions made from the LCS?",
        "agent": "Alright, I've got a good grasp of the question now. Thanks for clarifying. To make changes, we can modify the future probability. That's the mechanism at play here. So, if you want the finger to grow back, you'll need to increase the probability of that happening. However, what is the current probability of that occurrence? Let's say it's one in 100 million. Now, you'll have to decrease that probability significantly, maybe to something like one in ten, which is more likely to happen. But let me tell you, that's quite a challenging task. It requires a significant shift. Generally, we can only achieve things where there's enough uncertainty in the probability. It's this uncertainty that allows us to influence the outcome with our intent. Now, not everyone's intent is equal. You can have a stronger intent by focusing all your energy and having a clear and stable mind. There are also factors that can either enhance or diminish the power of your intent. But then again, we need to consider the uncertainty. When it comes to making a finger grow back, there's a substantial probability that it won't happen. Our bodies simply don't support that kind of regeneration. In such a case, the LCS (Large Computer System) would step in and take charge. It would be the one to make the finger grow back because, in a virtual reality like this, the LCS has the authority to do whatever it wants. It's the one rendering the virtual reality. It can..."

        "questioner": "In a virtual reality like this, what role does the LCS play in rendering the world and making changes based on desires? How does the LCS intervene in unlikely events and what is its purpose in expanding people's perspectives?",
        "agent": "In a virtual reality like this, the LCS has the ability to render the virtual world however it wishes. It can make changes based on its own desires. If the child expects the limb to grow back, it would increase the probability of it happening. This probability would be even higher if everyone around, including the parents and friends, also expects it to grow back. However, such an unlikely event would require the LCS to intervene and make the change. The LCS often interacts with people to expand their perspectives and show them that life is not limited to the material world and its rules. It aims to open people's minds to the possibilities of miracles and magic. By doing so, it helps individuals break free from their narrow thinking and consider the broader possibilities of reality. While such occurrences are generally considered impossible, there are instances where strange things happen. For example, I came across old pictures and black and white movies of a man who ran swords through himself. In his case, it was likely his strong intent and focus that allowed him to perform such acts."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you share a story or example of someone who had a remarkable ability to focus and manipulate outcomes, particularly in situations where they performed daring acts without getting hurt?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you about this guy I know named Tom Campbell. He was quite something. He had an incredible ability to focus and a strong intention to not get hurt. It's fascinating to think about what actually happened inside his body when he performed those daring acts. Unfortunately, we don't have any x-rays to see the exact impact on his organs. However, his intention to avoid harm likely reduced the probability of a fatal injury. Perhaps the object he swallowed, like a dagger or a knife, managed to navigate its way through his intestines without causing any major damage. It's hard to say for sure. Uncertainty played a significant role in his ability to manipulate the outcome. But, you know, there's always a limit to what one can handle. Eventually, he pushed it too far and swallowed something that cracked his certainty. Maybe he started to worry that this time it would actually hurt him. Or perhaps he simply reached a point where he had proven his point and should have stopped. It's possible that his decision to keep pushing the boundaries was a poor choice. But in the end, it was him, not the system, who made that decision. The system, on the other hand, may have played a role in opening people's minds to what is possible..."

        "questioner": "Can you provide an example of a rare occurrence where individuals with stage four cancer miraculously become cancer-free within a short period of time, defying the initial prognosis? How does the power of the mind and the uncertainties of the human body play a role in these cases?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you, it's not always right to blame the system for everything. Sometimes, it's the power of the mind that can truly make a difference. Take, for example, those rare cases where individuals have been diagnosed with stage four cancer and given only three months to live. Astonishingly, after just one week, they miraculously find themselves cancer-free. Now, I won't say it happens frequently, but it's not uncommon to hear about such cases occurring once or twice a year in major cities. It's truly mind-boggling how the human body, with all its uncertainties, can defy the odds like that. It goes to show that we still have so much to learn about the intricacies of biology and the mysteries of reality. And yes, we have the power to influence future outcomes. By honing our intent and focusing it with clarity, we can shape the probabilities in our favor. Of course, it helps if the larger conscious system decides to lend us a hand and showcase the strangeness of reality. But that's not something we can always count on. You see, if these miraculous recoveries were a common occurrence, they would lose their impact. People would come to expect them, and the element of surprise would be lost. It's the rarity of such events that makes them truly awe-inspiring. It challenges our understanding of reality and forces us to question the materialistic worldview that dismisses them as impossible. The truth is, reality is far more complex and enigmatic than we can comprehend."

        "questioner": "Can you share a fascinating story about individuals who lead fulfilling lives despite having limited brain tissue and missing crucial brain structures responsible for vision, muscle coordination, and auditory functions?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you a fascinating story. There are instances that defy our beliefs and seem impossible at first glance. However, these occurrences do happen, even though they may be difficult to explain. We encounter paradoxes that challenge our understanding. It's a combination of factors, including the Larger Consciousness System (LCS), individuals' focus, and the level of uncertainty involved in the process. Surprisingly, there are individuals who possess only a small amount of brain tissue, barely lining their skull. They lack the lobes responsible for vision, muscle coordination, and auditory functions. This condition arises from prenatal encephalitis, which fills their heads with fluid, preventing the brain from developing fully. Yet, despite this limited brain tissue, they lead fulfilling lives. Some even pursue higher education in mathematics and earn degrees. It's astonishing how they can function without the brain structures that typically make sense. These cases remained unknown until someone discovered their brain abnormalities through an accidental MRI scan. It's mind-boggling, but it happens. Researchers have studied such cases, and there are numerous documented instances of individuals with similar conditions. In fact, there are many more cases that we are aware of, where the pediatrician..."

        "questioner": "Can you provide insights into the factors that contribute to individuals with limited brain tissue leading fulfilling lives, despite missing crucial brain structures responsible for vision, muscle coordination, and auditory functions?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you about something fascinating that I've observed. There are numerous cases, and I mean dozens, where individuals were predicted to be born with encephalitis by their pediatricians while still in the womb. Now, as you might expect, most of these individuals end up in institutions or face significant challenges in functioning due to the absence of a fully developed brain. However, there is an intriguing pattern that emerges. The individuals who go on to lead normal lives are the ones whose condition went unnoticed during pregnancy. They were able to navigate life without any hindrances. It's almost as if the system, the Larger Consciousness System (LCS), orchestrated events to make it happen. Perhaps even the accident that led to the need for a Cat scan was part of this grand plan, allowing people to realize the hidden potential in these individuals. So, to answer your question, miracles do happen in the sense that highly improbable events can occur. However, probabilities cannot be absolute, either one or zero. There is always some level of uncertainty, and it is within this uncertainty that extraordinary things can take place. It's easier for us to achieve things that are not completely improbable."

    {
        "questioner": "Thank  you very much. And it does answer my question. My only little big question is when you talk about the intent, how do I tell my intent? Is my intent the thoughts I have? Do I create with my thoughts, my intent? Or how does the intent? Yes.",
        "agent": "Well, when it comes to intent, it's important to understand that it is essentially your thought. Think of it as your mental energy, although energy is just a metaphor in this context. Your intent requires a certain level of intensity and focus. It's not merely a wish like throwing a penny in a wishing well. To truly change the probability of something, you need to repeat the process multiple times. It also requires a clear and focused mind, free from distractions. Holding your intent for at least 15 to 20 minutes is recommended. During this time, it's crucial to avoid thoughts that question your effectiveness or whether you're doing it right. These intellectual doubts can nullify your intent. Instead, it should come from your being level, without any negative energy or doubts. Negative thoughts like 'I hope this works, but it probably won't' will only undermine your efforts."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you ensure that your intent is focused and free from negativity in order to increase the probability of achieving your desired outcome?",
        "agent": "I'm going to give it a shot. Well, those negative thoughts, they probably won't lead to success because they're also contributing to the idea that it won't work. So you really have to put your effort into it in a positive way. Now, in a religious context, that would be prayer. It's essentially the same concept. But what you're attempting to achieve is important, and the reasons behind it are important as well. So if you want to alter the probability to boost your ego, like saying 'I really want this' or 'I need more money' or 'I want a fancy coat because it will make me look stylish', well, those aren't really good reasons. From the perspective of the Larger Consciousness System (LCS), it's just feeding your ego and doesn't contribute to your personal growth. Therefore, the LCS won't invest much effort in supporting that. However, you might still increase the probability of getting your fancy coat, but it's not something that holds much value in the grand scheme of things. So that's part of the issue. What you want, why you want it, and how focused you are on it, without any negativity, will give you a strong determination."

        "questioner": "Thank  you very much, Tom. Okay,  Tom, this connects really well with one of Guillaume's questions about binaural been, if you haven't heard yet already, actually, Tom released a set of binaural beats this year, and I know a bunch of people have been trying them out. And Guillaume has some questions about perhaps customizing them and maybe adding some music on top of them. If you want to go any further, Guillaume, please go on ahead. Yeah,  I'm just curious if you add some instruments to any vulnerable beats, not necessarily those of you Thomas, but if you add other tones like string, quarkets, some synthetizer, do you kind of interfere with that tool for the meditative state? That's my question. Do you think that it's kind of ruining that thing?",
        "agent": "If someone chooses to incorporate other sounds or music with a binaural beat, it can enhance the experience depending on the desired outcome. For instance, if the goal is relaxation or finding an intuitive solution, adding background music that is personally pleasing and induces a positive state of mind can be helpful. The binaural beat will still function as intended, stimulating specific brain regions and facilitating communication between them. The presence of other sounds does not hinder its effectiveness. However, it is important to consider the emotional impact of music. Music has the power to evoke emotions and influence our state of mind. Therefore, if the intention is to relax, but the chosen music is energetic and makes one want to dance, the conflicting messages may not be conducive to the desired outcome. It is crucial to select music that aligns with the intended purpose and complements the binaural beat."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When it comes to optimizing productivity and focus, have you found that incorporating music into your activities has been beneficial? How can the right choice of music help create an environment that supports your goals and minimizes distractions?",
        "agent": "I've found that using the right kind of music can be a great way to enhance productivity and focus. Many people I know have successfully used music to complement their activities and achieve better results. When it comes to mixing different elements, such as reducing distractions, music can play a significant role. By finding the right balance and adjusting the volume or tempo, you can create an environment that supports your goals and helps you stay on track."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Two  tones that creating the binary beats, if you lower it to really lower the master of it, do you think that it will be also useful for staying in a meditative state?",
        "agent": "Yeah,  sure."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "To  keep it kind of really loud in the mix?",
        "agent": "No,  you don't have to keep it loud. You can make it subtle. If you make it subtle, it'll still work. Now, will it work as well? Will it put you in that state and lock you there as strongly? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that you're making this cooperation between the music and the binaural beat and to put the binaural beat in to where it's almost subliminal, where you can't really hear it, it's just in there, but it's just there that if you know about and think about it, you can hear it, but otherwise you wouldn't notice it. It'll still do its thing, it'll still create brain entrainment to theta state just the same but it won't necessarily do it as strongly if that was the only thing you were listening to. So it'll still have its effect. It may not be as strong effect or as immediate effect but it'll still work. Doesn't have to be loud or dominant but its effect will probably be more subtle. The effect won't be the sledgehammer effect, it'll be a more subtle effect. Now Guillaume, you had another question. Would you like to ask that as well while we're on you?"
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah,  sure. Quite simple question. You talk a bit with Caroline about the negative towards self. So my question is about that. I've been through a lot of negative self talk those last years and I'm kind of tired of it, of listening to that old tape and not feeling good about myself sometime. And I want to ask is that negative self talk kind of useful? Is there a way to reduce considerably this flow of shitty self talk? I kind of think that the more you meditate the more you are aware of that kind of stream. And I just want to finish with saying sometimes I feel like I can't afford the luxury of a negative tough in the pursuit of happiness and lowering the entropy of my consciousness.",
        "agent": "Well, I believe that having negative thoughts is a luxury we can't afford. There is absolutely nothing good about it, no advantage to be gained, and it never brings any good. It's always negative, and that's the most self-defeating thing one can do - constantly putting oneself down and entertaining negative thoughts. Thoughts like 'I'm not good enough,' 'I don't know enough,' 'I'm not smart enough,' 'I'm not fast enough,' 'I'm not strong enough,' 'I'm not whatever.' The list can go on and on, and if you focus on these thoughts, they will hold you down. It's like trying to swim with a cement block fastened to your back - it just makes everything else difficult. So, in my opinion, the worst thing you can do is to have a negative stream of thoughts about what you're doing and how you're doing it. However, it doesn't mean that you should never take a serious look at yourself. Sometimes, there might be negative aspects that need addressing, but you shouldn't keep iterating on them endlessly. Instead, you can look at yourself and say, 'Okay, if I want a better job, I probably need to go to school and learn some new skills.' Then, you can make a plan and take action. So, it's not that you can't be critical of yourself and come up with a plan, but it's important not to get stuck in a loop of self-doubt and self-pity. Just saying, 'I can't seem to get a job that pays enough, it's so unfair, and I can't seem to do it. I've been trying and trying, and nothing works. I guess I'm just not good enough to get promoted.' It's a never-ending cycle that leads nowhere..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can one break free from the cycle of negative self-talk and its detrimental effects on personal growth and success?",
        "agent": "And nothing works. And I guess I'm just not good enough to get promoted. And continuously dwelling on that thought is counterproductive and always poses a problem. So if anyone finds themselves trapped in a cycle of negative self-talk, that's likely the main issue. The constant self-deprecation hinders progress in all aspects of life. Simply putting an end to that self-destructive mindset would likely lead to positive outcomes. Even without taking any other action, just stopping the self-degradation would greatly improve life. Relationships would flourish, work would improve, and that promotion you desire would likely come your way. The negative self-talk has a detrimental effect on your interactions, relationships, and overall performance. It sabotages your chances of success. It increases the likelihood of things going wrong and diminishes your chances of achieving your goals. It's a self-defeating cycle. Yes, getting caught in a loop of self-denigration is never beneficial. It's okay to reflect on your flaws and be self-critical, but don't keep replaying that negative tape over and over again. If you're critical of yourself, either accept it or take action to fix it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When faced with negative self-talk and its detrimental effects on personal growth and success, what are the two options you have to break free from this cycle and improve your situation?",
        "agent": "When it comes to understanding yourself, you have two options: either accept the situation as it is or take action to change it. It's easy to get caught up in a cycle of complaining about how things aren't going well, but that very cycle might be the root cause of your problems."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "I  guess it's clear that it's not useful. But now, how can I fix that, Tom?",
        "agent": "It's not useful. That's an understatement. To fix it, you need to have a strong will to resist engaging in negative self-talk. Whenever you catch yourself berating and criticizing yourself, it's important to stop and shift your focus to positive things. Think about the people who care about you and all the positive aspects of your life. For instance, in wintertime, you can appreciate the warmth and comfort you have. By consciously replacing negative thoughts with positive ones, you can counteract the negative feedback loop. Remind yourself that you have the power to make positive things happen. Start cultivating positive thoughts about your potential and your life. Everyone has some positive things happening in their life, even if it's hard to see them when you're in a negative mindset. It's crucial to break free from that negativity and shift your focus to the positive aspects. Recognize that there are many positive things happening in almost everyone's life, and make a conscious effort to concentrate on them. Focus on your potential, where you want to go, and how you will achieve your goals. Tom, you once mentioned the concept of 'wallowing in gratitude,' which is the complete opposite of wallowing in self-pity. Instead of dwelling on all the terrible things, it's about embracing gratitude and appreciating the positive aspects of life."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When you find yourself in a negative mindset, what strategies can you employ to shift your perspective and cultivate a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the positive aspects of your life?",
        "agent": "When I find myself wallowing in self-pity, I remind myself of the power of gratitude. Instead of focusing on all the terrible things and feeling like a little bit of nothing, I shift my perspective and appreciate the positive aspects of my life. For instance, I acknowledge that I have a warm shelter while it's cold outside, I have food in the refrigerator, and I have friends who care about me. I also remember that my mother loves me and my dog brings me joy. By consciously recognizing and appreciating these things, I break free from the cycle of negativity and start to feel more content. It's important to realize that there are people who have less than I do, and by expressing gratitude, I cultivate a sense of abundance. The more I focus on the positive aspects of my life, the longer the list becomes, and the happier I feel. So, instead of wallowing in self-pity, I choose to embrace gratitude as the antidote to negativity."
