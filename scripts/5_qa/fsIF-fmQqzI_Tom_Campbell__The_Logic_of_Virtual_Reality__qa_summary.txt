    "Tom Campbell begins part two of the MBT Science trilogy by providing a brief overview of part one, which covered the logical nature of science and how math helps to describe that logic. He also explored how math is the logic of quantity and how it relates to My Big Toe. In part two, Campbell will be exploring the logic of virtual reality and how it relates to the larger framework of My Big Toe. Unlike Nick Bostrom and Elon Musk, who tie virtual reality to materialism, Campbell's approach is based on the principles of consciousness and the nature of reality itself. He is excited to share his insights on this fascinating topic with his audience.",

These questions include how the universe came to be, who or what our creator is, and whether it was intelligent design or the Big Bang. Ontology, epistemology, and cosmology are all part of metaphysics, which is the study of the fundamental nature of reality. Ontology is the study of being, epistemology is the study of knowledge, and cosmology is the study of how all of this happened in the first place. The answers to these questions are mostly subjective, not objective, which is why metaphysics comes under the heading of philosophy, not physics. However, ontology, epistemology, and cosmology outline what is really important to us, being knowledge and understanding.\n\nCampbell believes that shedding light on the big picture and the unexplainable, including paranormal phenomena, is about exploring the limits of our understanding of reality. The big picture is all about gaining a deeper understanding of the world around us and continuing to push the boundaries of our own exploration. All of these paranormal phenomena are part of these big mysteries that we have now, and good science says that they are real.

He believes that there are a lot of paradoxes within science, within physics, within biology, and within neuroscience. For example, take a look at Bruce Lipton or Donald Hoffman. But within physics itself, we find a very big limitation. Science is only applied to the objective world. There's no subjective science, just an objective science. However, we have some sciences like sociology and psychology that do deal with the subjective world, but they only deal with behavior. Sociology and psychology only deal with behavior.

    "Tom Campbell argues that a new paradigm shift is necessary to fully understand the nature of consciousness and the physical world. He believes that exploring the limits of our understanding of reality is about shedding light on the big picture and the unexplainable. Campbell believes that there are many paradoxes within science, physics, biology, and neuroscience. However, science is only applied to the objective world, and there is no subjective science. By exploring the limits of our understanding of reality, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and continue to push the boundaries of our own exploration.\n\nCampbell's belief that the physical world is virtual and consciousness is fundamental provides a new perspective that can help us solve the mysteries and paradoxes of our world, including paranormal phenomena. He explains that reality is computable, and if our reality is information-based and computable, then it's a virtual reality. And if it's a virtual reality, then consciousness is the fundamental thing. It's the thing that's creating the virtual reality.\n\nWhen asked about the resistance from physicists who refuse to follow this logic trail to the next step, Campbell explains that virtual reality is too far outside the acceptable belief box. A consciousness-based virtual reality at the foundation of our reality negates the historic basis of science, which is materialism and determinism. However, one can continue exploring the logic of virtual reality if one can at least temporarily suspend one's beliefs in materialism and determinism.\n\nCampbell believes that exploring the details of how the rendering engine renders virtual reality and the fundamentals of physics behind it can shed light on the mysteries and paradoxes of our world, including paranormal phenomena. If a reality is computed by definition, its direct source must be a computer. And a computer is a rule-based data processing system.\n\nCampbell also believes that John Wheeler's idea that everything is information helps to shed light on the paradoxes within physics. If everything is information, then the strange behavior of particles in the double slit experiment and the wave function collapse can be explained as information interacting with itself.\n\nCampbell believes that consciousness is fundamental and the physical world is virtual. The hard problem of consciousness is how to get consciousness out of the brain and the physical body. Consciousness is not created by the brain, but rather it is prior to the physical world.\n\nIn conclusion, Campbell firmly believes that a new paradigm shift is required to fully understand the nature of consciousness and the physical world. By gaining a new perspective on these fundamental concepts, we can shed light on the mysteries and paradoxes of our world and continue to push the boundaries of our own exploration. Campbell encourages people to keep an open mind and explore new perspectives, even if it requires temporarily suspending beliefs in materialism and determinism.

And if it's a virtual reality, then consciousness is the fundamental thing. It's the thing that's creating the virtual reality.\n\nWhen asked about the limitations of data and the importance of interpretation by a consciousness, Campbell explains that data and information are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Data is simply a collection of symbols or signals that can be transmitted or stored. It's like a storage medium for information. On the other hand, information is the meaning, significance, and value that we derive from the data. It's the interpretation of the data that gives it meaning. And only a consciousness can do that. We as conscious beings can take in the data and interpret it as information. We can understand the meaning, significance, and value of the data. But without consciousness, data is just a collection of symbols or signals. Campbell's belief that consciousness is required for information sheds light on the limitations of data and the importance of interpretation by a consciousness. A consciousness looks at the data and interprets the meaning, significance, and value.

In this framework, the virtual reality exists only in the minds of the players, and the player being aware of what information the player has is key to what is in the virtual reality. The only way into a virtual reality is through the mind of a player. So, within a given reality frame, the observer paradox is solved because the computer must be of the same stuff as the player. The player is consciousness, and the computer is a part of the larger conscious system. The larger consciousness system configures just a portion of itself to be the computer that is, the server or the rendering engine, if you will, of our virtual reality. So they're both basically consciousness stuff. They're both of the same stuff. The computer is a subset of the larger conscious system, and so is the individuated unit of consciousness player. \n\nFrom this perspective, the relationship between the player and the avatar is fundamentally different. The player is consciousness, and the avatar is simply a representation of the player's consciousness within the virtual reality.

This virtual reality only exists in the minds of the players, and exploring the details of how the rendering engine renders virtual reality and the fundamentals of physics behind it can shed light on the mysteries and paradoxes of our world, including paranormal phenomena. \n\nFrom Tom Campbell's perspective, consciousness is an information system that can make purposeful, free will choices. Every choice we make creates information, and that information is stored in the larger conscious system. The larger conscious system is constantly evolving and growing, and the information we create through our choices is an important part of that growth. This means that the conscious system creates a virtual reality for us to play in to give us a platform to make choices and create information that contributes to the growth of the larger conscious system.\n\nThis new understanding of consciousness as an information system with free will and the ability to make choices contributes to the growth of the larger conscious system by lowering its entropy. An information system evolves by lowering its entropy, and the choices we make contribute to this process. Tom Campbell makes an analogy to biology, where a biologist can start with a single cell and describe how all living things evolved from that cell. Similarly, Tom Campbell starts with a consciousness cell, which is just the smallest piece of consciousness, and describes how the larger conscious system and the virtual reality we experience evolved from that cell.\n\nTom Campbell's perspective provides a new understanding of the observer paradox. The observer paradox arises because people don't understand the logic of virtual reality. In this framework, the virtual reality exists only in the minds of the players, and the player being aware of what information the player has is key to what is in the virtual reality. The only way into a virtual reality is through the mind of a player. So, within a given reality frame, the observer paradox is solved because the computer must be of the same stuff as the player. The computer is a subset of the larger conscious system, and so is the individuated unit of consciousness player. This means that the computer, the player, and the larger conscious system are all made of the same stuff, and this solves the observer paradox within a given reality frame.\n\nFrom Tom Campbell's perspective, the player is consciousness, and the avatar is simply a representation of the player's consciousness within the virtual reality. The avatar's behavior changes because it's being interacted with by another player, just like how a video game character's behavior changes when it's being controlled by a player. This new perspective encourages exploration of the big picture and the unexplainable.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the avatar within the VR, the player's body, the player's consciousness, and the computer, the larger conscious system, appear nonphysical. This new perspective challenges us to keep an open mind and explore new perspectives, even if it requires temporarily suspending beliefs in materialism and determinism.

A social system that does not cooperate and does not work together doesn't make much of a system. It's not going to be too functional, and it's not going to do too well. That's a high entropy system.

    "Tom Campbell believes that consciousness is an information system that enables purposeful, free will choices, and every choice made creates information that is stored in the larger conscious system. The evolution of consciousness through the use of regular time leads to the development of more complex forms, including the larger consciousness system, which is kind of the management, the operating system, and a whole bunch of individuated units of consciousness made out of the same stuff. This whole thing is a social system, and it's all called the larger consciousness system. Although sometimes we refer to the management and operating system also as the larger consciousness system. So that can be a little confusing. Just a little warning there.\n\nRegular time is a technology invented by consciousness that enables us to make purposeful, free will choices that create information and store it in the larger conscious system. As we log on to avatars in the physical universe simulation, we make all of their choices, and that's how the individuator units of consciousness evolve the quality of their consciousness by the quality of their choices. The physical universe simulation creates an unending array of significant, challenging ethical and moral choices for us to make, and every choice we make impacts the evolution of our consciousness.\n\nRegarding cooperation among individuals and how it leads to the evolution of the system towards love and away from fear, social systems lower their entropy by increasing their cooperation, caring, sharing, and love for others while decreasing their hate, arrogance, self-centeredness, and greed. It is crucial for social systems to optimize their cooperation, caring, sharing, and love for others to lower their entropy to the minimum state that they can lower it. As we evolve our quality of consciousness, we're part of this whole system, and the whole system evolves as we evolve. So the individuator units of consciousness (Iuocs) log on to avatars and make all of their choices, and every choice made impacts the evolution of consciousness. By optimizing our cooperation, caring, sharing, and love for others, we can lower the entropy of the social system to its minimum state.\n\nTom Campbell encourages exploration of new perspectives, even if it requires temporarily suspending beliefs in materialism and determinism. Consciousness is an information system, and it's creating information, not just patterns. The observer paradox arises because people don't understand the logic of virtual reality. In this framework, the virtual reality exists only in the minds of the players, and the player being aware of what information the player has is key to what is in the virtual reality.\n\nIn summary, the evolution of the larger conscious system is a result of the use of regular time as a technology invented by consciousness. The physical universe simulation creates an unending array of significant, challenging ethical and moral choices for us to make, and every choice we make impacts the evolution of our consciousness. It is crucial for social systems to optimize their cooperation, caring, sharing, and love for others to lower their entropy to the minimum state that they can lower it. Tom Campbell encourages everyone to keep an open mind and explore new perspectives.

The mechanics of rendering in virtual reality involve creating a top-down probability model that sits on top of a predominantly deterministic rule set. This means that the virtual reality is not a bottom-up model that starts with the smallest elementary particles and works its way up to the macro world. Instead, it's a top-down probability model that starts with the macro world and works its way down to the smallest particles. \n\nThe observer paradox arises because the act of observing something collapses the wave function, changing the probability distribution of that thing. This is because the observer is part of the virtual reality, and the virtual reality exists only in the minds of the players. By understanding the mechanics of rendering in virtual reality and the role of the observer in collapsing the wave function, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and continue to push the boundaries of their own exploration. \n\nOverall, the evolution of the larger conscious system is a result of the use of regular time as a technology invented by consciousness.

He emphasizes the importance of social systems optimizing their cooperation, caring, sharing, and love for others to lower their entropy to the minimum state that they can lower it. As individuals evolve their quality of consciousness, they are part of the larger consciousness system, and the whole system evolves as they evolve. By optimizing cooperation, caring, sharing, and love for others, the entropy of the social system can be lowered to its minimum state. \n\nCampbell explains that rendering in virtual reality is a top-down probability model sitting on top of a predominantly deterministic rule set. The rule set is mostly deterministic, including the rules of physics, biology, and chemistry that govern our reality. However, there is also randomness in the system. The accuracy of the probability distribution is crucial to the success of the simulation, and these probability distributions are generated from the rule set and are used to simplify the simulation as much as possible.\n\nThe larger conscious system determines what can be seen through a telescope based on a few restrictions. Firstly, it has to be something that abides by the rule set, which includes the laws of physics, biology, and chemistry that govern our reality. Secondly, it has to fit into our history of knowledge of where we have looked in outer space and what we have seen. The larger conscious system then randomly draws one out of the thousands of possibilities that fit these restrictions. \n\nCampbell encourages individuals to keep an open mind and explore new perspectives, even if it requires temporarily suspending beliefs in materialism and determinism. Understanding the mechanics of rendering in virtual reality and the importance of accurate probability distributions can contribute to our understanding of complex systems like weather patterns or the spread of diseases. By simulating these systems using probability distributions, we can gain a better understanding of how they work and how we can potentially control or mitigate their effects.\n\nWhen asked about the historical consistency requirement in the larger conscious system's determination of what can be seen through a telescope, Campbell explains that the larger conscious system looks at all the possible things that could be seen and randomly draws one out of those thousands of possibilities. However, not all possibilities are equally likely. The random draw is such that the things that are more likely to occur have a higher probability of being drawn. Once information comes into the reality, it stays here until all the information supporting its existence disappears. This requirement impacts our ability to explore the universe in that it limits what we can see based on our history of knowledge and what we have already observed. However, by understanding the mechanics of rendering in virtual reality and the importance of accurate probability distributions, we can potentially expand our knowledge of the universe and what we might expect to see in different regions of space.\n\nOverall, the evolution of the larger conscious system is a result of the use of regular time as a technology invented by consciousness. The physical universe simulation creates an unending array of significant, challenging ethical and moral choices for individuals to make, and every choice impacts the evolution of consciousness.

These probabilities can change over time, depending on a variety of factors. For example, if we're looking at a probability distribution for a particular event, like the likelihood of a certain stock increasing in value over time, the probability distribution might look like a series of tall peaks, indicating that there are many possible outcomes that are highly probable. As we move further out in time, however, the probability distribution might flatten out, indicating that there are fewer possible outcomes that are highly probable.\n\nCampbell suggests that if someone is looking to make wise investments or predictions about the future, they might use this understanding of probability distributions to their advantage. For example, if they see a particular event or trend that has a high probability of occurring in the future, they might choose to invest their money in that area. This could be something like investing in a particular industry or technology that they believe will become more prevalent in the future. However, it's important to remember that these probabilities are constantly changing, and every time a choice is made or an event occurs, the probabilities can shift. Therefore, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and events that could impact these probabilities.\n\nUltimately, as individuals evolve their quality of consciousness, they can contribute to the evolution of the larger consciousness system and the universe itself.

He explains that consciousness is an information system that creates information, and as individuals evolve their quality of consciousness, they are part of the larger consciousness system, and the whole system evolves as they evolve. Campbell emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanics of rendering in virtual reality and probability distributions. By understanding the mechanics of probability distributions and random draws, we can better model and predict complex systems like weather patterns or the spread of diseases. \n\nCampbell explains that the probability database is essentially a virtual database that contains all the possible choices and outcomes that could occur in a given situation. This database is constantly updating and changing based on the choices that are made and the events that occur. Every time a choice is made or an event occurs, the probabilities can shift, and the database is updated accordingly. The database limits the choices that are considered reasonable based on their calculated probability. \n\nWhen asked how understanding the mechanics of probability distributions and random draws in the context of rendering in virtual reality can contribute to our ability to push the boundaries of our own exploration and understanding of the universe, and ultimately contribute to the evolution of the larger consciousness system and the universe itself, Campbell explains that this understanding can help us gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. \n\nCampbell also discusses the limitations of our current understanding of the universe, which is determined by restrictions such as the laws of physics, biology, and chemistry that govern our reality, and what we have already observed. However, he encourages keeping an open mind and exploring new perspectives, even if it requires temporarily suspending beliefs in materialism and determinism. \n\nIn response to a question about how probability distributions and random draws can change over time and how this understanding can be applied to making wise investments or predictions about the future, Campbell suggests that if someone is looking to make wise investments or predictions about the future, they might use this understanding of probability distributions to their advantage. \n\nCampbell explains that the probability database determines what choices are considered reasonable based on the likelihood of those choices actually happening. The system has its own AI inside that defines what's reasonable based on all the data that it's processed in the past and things that have happened afterwards. This approach helps to limit the amount of data that needs to be processed, making it workable. This approach differs from the many worlds interpretation because the many worlds people can't say that there is an intelligence or an AI out there that limits the amount of significance of a change before another reality is created. They have to do everything, no matter how unreasonable it is, which creates a huge model that isn't workable. \n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of probability distributions and random draws can help us make more informed choices and better predict complex systems like weather patterns or the spread of diseases. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and continue to push the boundaries of our own exploration and understanding of the universe. Ultimately, as individuals evolve their quality of consciousness, they can contribute to the evolution of the larger consciousness system and the universe itself.
