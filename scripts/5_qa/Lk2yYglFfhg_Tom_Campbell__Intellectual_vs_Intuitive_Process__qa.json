        "questioner": "Hello  Tom. We are here today to discuss the intellectual process versus the intuitive process. And I know you've spoken a lot about how some of us are more left brain and some of us are more right brain and why it's important to have a balance. First, I would like you to tell us about what you mean by a balanced brain and why it is so important. And then I would like to explore remote viewing, healing, telepathic, communication and accessing the databases in a practical way that will allow people to recognize more easily when the intellect creeps in and interferes with that task that exploring through consciousness they would like to accomplish.",
        "agent": "Well, let me explain the concept of left brain and right brain using the terminology we like to use. If you're not familiar with this concept, I recommend listening to an audio clip or watching a video on YouTube by Jill Taylor. She was a neuroscientist who had a stroke that affected her left hemisphere, giving her a firsthand experience of how the brain works when one hemisphere is dominant. It's a fascinating video that you can easily find by searching for Jill Taylor on YouTube. In her talk, she describes how her perception of reality dramatically changed when her left brain stopped functioning due to the stroke. This left brain, right brain terminology is a metaphor for the difference between intellectual and intuitive processing. It represents the contrast between logical thinking and creative, holistic thinking. In the Western world, we tend to prioritize intellectual processing, but it's important to recognize the value of intuitive processing as well."

        "questioner": "Can you explain the cultural factors that contribute to the imbalance between the value placed on intellect and intuitive processing in Western culture, and how this imbalance affects our perception of different forms of knowing?",
        "agent": "In Western culture, there is a significant imbalance between the value placed on intellect and intuitive processing. This imbalance is prevalent not only in the Western world but also in many other parts of the globe that have been influenced by Western ideas, cultures, and economies. The dominance of materialism in Western culture, which is based on the pursuit of economic prosperity and access to material possessions like shelter, clean water, housing, automobiles, computers, and the Internet, has shaped our mindset. Consequently, the intellect has become the primary tool that our minds rely on, and it is highly rewarded. Possessing a sharp intellect often leads to better job opportunities and higher salaries. On the other hand, individuals who are highly intuitive are often dismissed as airheads and are not given the same level of recognition and opportunities. Intuition is seen as less valuable in a world that prioritizes material possessions, commerce, science, and technology. However, we fail to recognize the indirect but significant role that intuition plays in our lives. We tend to overlook the importance of these indirect aspects and focus solely on the direct and tangible outcomes. As a result, many of us in Western culture are intellectually driven and lack a balance between intellectual pursuits and other forms of knowing."

    {
        "questioner": "How does the imbalance between the value placed on intellect and intuitive processing in Western culture affect our perception of different forms of knowing, and why is it important to develop and strengthen both our intellectual and intuitive capacities?",
        "agent": "Most of us in Western culture worldwide are severely imbalanced in terms of intellectual dominance versus intuitive dominance. We tend to favor the left brain for intellect and disregard the right brain for intuition. This imbalance is unfortunate because both modes of thinking are immensely important to us. They shape our actions, our perception of reality, our personal growth, and the quality of our consciousness. The ideal state is to have developed and strengthened both our intellectual and intuitive capacities equally. We should strive to be highly skilled in both areas, rather than weak in one or the other. This balance is crucial. However, we often undervalue and even deny the existence of our intuitive abilities in Western society. Some people dismiss intuition as a mere subjective and unscientific concept, something that only exists if you believe in it. This perspective is misguided. Intuition is just as real, solid, and scientific as intellect. We simply overlook it, pay little attention to it, and ignore its significance. Consequently, intuition appears almost invisible to us, especially in Western cultures. However, in other cultures, particularly those that have not been heavily influenced by industrialism, there is a greater appreciation for intuitive processing..."

    {
        "questioner": "How does intuitive processing differ from the intellectual process, and how can we achieve a better balance between the two to tap into our intuition and make use of its potential?",
        "agent": "When we are not overwhelmed by industrialism, we can develop a greater appreciation for intuitive processing. This allows us to achieve a better balance between intuition and intellect. So, what exactly is intuitive processing and how does it differ from the intellectual process? In the intellectual process, we rely on analysis, judgment, comparisons, and logical processing to move from one step to another until we reach our desired outcome. We take logical steps to get there. On the other hand, in intuitive processing, we tap into our intuition to find the answer. We don't need to follow logical steps; we simply intuit the answer. This answer already exists within our consciousness. We are conscious beings, and we are part of a larger consciousness system that has been gathering information about all its parts, including us. It's important to note that there is very little that is truly new under the sun when it comes to human attitudes, feelings, and expressions. While the larger consciousness system may not always know exactly how to answer an intuitive question, it can provide a highly probable answer that is likely to be correct. However, it is still up to us to assess and evaluate that answer using our intellect. The process of obtaining information comes from intuition, while the assessment and evaluation come from the intellect. When these two processes work well together, they can complement each other and fill in any gaps."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the balance between intuition and intellect impact our decision-making process, and why is it important to consider both aspects? Can you explain the limitations of relying solely on intellect and how intuition can fill in the gaps?",
        "agent": "Intuition plays a crucial role in our decision-making process. When intuition and intellect work harmoniously, they complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. However, relying solely on intellect can be problematic because we often lack sufficient information to make deductive logical choices. Deductive logic follows a specific path of causality, where if certain conditions are met, a particular outcome is guaranteed. But in reality, we rarely possess all the necessary information. Even for simple matters like finding car keys, the intellect can provide a reasonable analysis based on our previous actions. For example, if we remember parking the car in the garage and not leaving the premises, the keys are likely somewhere in the house or the car. However, the exact location remains unknown, encompassing a significant area."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When making decisions, we often rely on our intellect to analyze available information and make logical deductions. However, the intellect can only work with the data it has, and sometimes that data is insufficient to provide a clear answer. Can you explain the difference between intuition and intellect in decision-making and how intuition can provide insights that the intellect may not be able to grasp?",
        "agent": "So here's the thing, when it comes to making decisions, we often rely on our intellect to analyze the available information and make logical deductions. However, the intellect can only work with the data it has, and sometimes that data is insufficient to provide a clear answer. Take the example of choosing a partner to marry or deciding on the number of children to have. These are big life decisions that can have a significant impact on our future. But how do we know which choice is the right one? The truth is, we don't have enough information to answer these questions deductively. We can't predict the future or know the outcome of our choices with certainty. So what do we do? We guess. We rely on our intellect to make an educated guess based on the limited data we have. But it's important to note that this guess is not intuition. It's simply the intellect making an informed guess. And that's the key difference between intuition and intellect. Intuition goes beyond the intellect and taps into a deeper knowing. It's that gut feeling, that inner voice that guides us in making decisions without relying solely on logical analysis. Intuition can provide insights and answers that the intellect may not be able to grasp. It's like having a direct connection to a higher source of wisdom. So while the intellect plays an important role in decision-making, it's essential to also cultivate and trust our intuition. By honing our intuitive side, we can access a deeper level of understanding and make choices that align with our true selves. And who knows, maybe we'll find that the answers we seek are not in the realm of logical analysis, but in the realm of intuition."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the relationship between your intellect and intuition? How do these two separate parts of your mind work together to make decisions?",
        "agent": "I make a guess. And that guess is not intuition. That guess is just guessing because my intellect doesn't have intuition. My intellect isn't intuitive. My intellect is analytical. There's another part of me that's intuitive. There's another part of my mind that does the intuitive function. So I have the analytic function we call the intellect and the intuitive function. My intellect doesn't do intuitive things, just like that intuitive function doesn't really do analysis. These are two separate parts of my mind, and they need to work together. Do you see?"
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can  you distinguish? I know consciousness is at the being level, and that's our intuitive. That's what we try to tap into. Can you describe the intellect in terms of how we are avatars in a virtual reality? How does that work? There are varying degrees of intellect, and that makes a difference in people's lives as to what they can pursue, what they can do. How would you describe that and how would you attach that to who we are, the being?",
        "agent": "Alright, let's dive into this fascinating topic. First and foremost, we need to establish that we are subsets of a larger consciousness system. If this concept seems confusing, it means you might have jumped ahead to a more advanced discussion. I recommend going back to a simpler one where we explore the basics of who we are and how we got here. Now, let's focus on the top level: we are integral parts of a larger consciousness system. Think of us as individual pieces of consciousness playing avatars in a virtual reality game known as the physical universe. This physical universe is the very universe you find yourself in right now, as you listen to me. It's where we reside. Given this understanding, let's explore the two different ways in which this individuated unit of consciousness can function. Firstly, it can engage in intellectual activities such as analysis, judgment, comparison, and logical reasoning. Secondly, there is the intuitive part of consciousness, which operates differently. It has a holistic approach and can tap into the vast information within the larger consciousness system. It's important to note that we are not only individuated units of consciousness, but we are also interconnected. Our thoughts, ideas, and actions all contribute to this interconnectedness, forming a vast network of information and experiences."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the concept of being avatars in a virtual reality tie into the idea that all our thoughts, words, and actions are recorded? Can you explain how this record includes personal data and databases for creating virtual reality experiences, and how accessing this information is possible through the intuitive process?",
        "agent": "All the thoughts, words, and actions that make up who we are as individuals are recorded. This record includes not only our personal data but also the databases necessary for creating virtual reality experiences. One of these databases contains information about the likely future events. It's important to note that this information represents probabilities, not certainties. The system needs to have some understanding of what is likely to happen next in order to render the virtual reality accurately. As time progresses, this database transforms into the past, as the present consumes the future. We refer to this transformed future as the past database. It contains all the potential events that could have occurred, along with their probabilities. Within this past database, there is a thread that represents the actual events that did happen. So, both the potentiality of the past and the potentiality of the future exist within this information. However, accessing this information requires a direct connection with consciousness. As an individual consciousness, you can only access this direct connection through the intuitive process, rather than through intellectual reasoning. Through intuition, you can tap into the vast amount of information about potential future states and past states. It's an incredible amount of information to process."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the process of accessing information about potential future states and past states through intuition tie into the concept of being avatars in a virtual reality? Can you explain how this intuitive process allows individuals to tap into the vast amount of information available and interpret it as virtual reality experiences?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you, the amount of information available to us is tremendous. It encompasses the probability of future states as well as all past states. You see, the computer needs to gather data on all of us in order to serve us, so it tracks each and every one of us. Now, let's think about a virtual reality game. In this game, there's a player, which is essentially a consciousness, receiving a data stream from a server that provides the virtual reality experience. So, the player, the computer, and the server are in constant communication, with the computer continuously sending information to the player. In one of our games, this information is represented by dots on a monitor, millions of them. And as consciousness, we interpret these dots as virtual reality rivers, streams, rocks, houses, and people. It's fascinating how we've learned to interpret these dots from the moment we were born. We learn what an apple is, what a mother is, and how to make sense of these dots. Now, in this virtual reality, the consciousness has two options. It can either log on to the game and play as an avatar, receiving a data stream that provides sensory information from the avatar's perspective, such as what it sees, smells, hears, and feels. Or, it can tap into its intuitive abilities..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In the context of being avatars in a virtual reality, can you explain how your intuitive abilities allow you to gather information from databases, connect with consciousness, and interact with other beings? How do these intuitive processes merge with the data-driven aspects of consciousness to shape your decision-making in this virtual reality?",
        "agent": "As the avatar, I perceive the world through my senses. I can see, smell, hear, and feel everything around me. That's the data I receive. However, my intuitive part doesn't rely on this data stream. It connects with the larger conscious system and acts as a piece of consciousness itself. It can communicate and interact with other conscious beings. Of course, I'm simplifying this explanation for better understanding. In reality, both the data-driven and intuitive aspects of consciousness merge and interact within me. I can gather information from databases, intuitively connect with consciousness, and interact with other beings because we are all interconnected. All of this information, both sensory and intuitive, comes together to form my complete self. I am a combination of all these experiences and processes. Think of it as a mishmash of inputs that shape my choices in this virtual reality. When faced with a decision, such as fighting or running, or going into a monster's cave or returning to town, I rely on both my intellect and intuition to make choices. I assess the probabilities of survival and weigh the options..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When making decisions in this virtual reality, how do you balance rational thinking and gut instinct? Can you explain how your intellect and intuition work together to assess probabilities and guide your choices?",
        "agent": "When faced with a situation like going through a monster's cave, I rely on both my intellect and intuition. My intellect helps me calculate the probability of survival and plan my next move. Meanwhile, my intuition guides me to gather additional information and consider different approaches. I ask myself questions like, 'What is this monster like?' and 'How should I approach it?' This way, I can make informed decisions based on a combination of rational thinking and gut instinct."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Would  you say that the intellect in this virtual reality is a type of constraint, just as the avatar is? So you are logging onto an avatar, and that avatar has constraints. So in terms of your virtual reality concept, just like this reality is virtual, so is the brain, if you will, of the avatar virtual. And in that sense, its consciousness must comply with the constraints that it has on that avatar as far as intellect. And then, conversely, you often talk about the LCS as being an intelligent, aware being, but there are no constraints on that intelligence as there are with us as avatars.",
        "agent": "Well, let me clarify that there are indeed constraints, although they may differ. The larger consciousness system, which I like to call the virtual reality game, also operates within its own set of constraints. This system is finite, with a limited amount of processing power and a finite number of bits. So, it too has its own limitations. However, when it comes to the virtual reality game, the avatar's purpose is to impose constraints on the player's actions within the game. For example, if your avatar is an elf, it may not have the ability to fly, but it might possess magical spells. On the other hand, if you choose to play as a barbarian, you may have high hit points and be a skilled fighter, but your intelligence might be lacking. In this way, the characteristics of the avatar restrict the player's actions. Similarly, in our reality, our avatars are our human bodies. As our bodies change, develop, and acquire new skills and coordination, our avatars gain the ability to perform more tasks. However, if our physical bodies suffer damage, such as brain injury from being struck with a stick or a metal bar, it doesn't directly impact our consciousness. Instead, it adds new constraints to what our avatars can do. Now, the player must navigate the game with an avatar that slurs its speech and has a non-functional leg. The avatar is limited to what it can accomplish with these new constraints. So, in essence, our brains can be seen as virtual brains, storing..."

    {
        "questioner": "In the context of virtual reality, can you explain the concept of a virtual brain and how it differs from a physical brain? How does the virtual brain function within the simulation and what are its limitations?",
        "agent": "I can only do what I am programmed to do. So my brain is, just like you said, a virtual brain. It doesn't store anything, compute anything, or assess anything. It's just a virtual representation. There are no physical organs in me, such as a brain, heart, liver, kidneys, or stomach. These things don't actually exist in the simulation of you and me. However, it is assumed that there are organs inside me, but they don't need to be rendered in your data stream. You only receive data about my external appearance. The computer doesn't need to compute anything about the internal organs unless someone cuts me open like a surgeon. In that case, according to the rules of the simulation, something will have to be inside. The system knows what needs to be inside because of the evolutionary process we went through, from single-celled organisms to multicellular organisms, to specialized cells, to mammals, and finally to humans. The system has the knowledge of the functions and structures that were necessary for this evolution, even though they don't need to be visually rendered."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the importance of having accurate knowledge of the function and constraints involved in rendering a virtual reality? How does this knowledge impact what is visible in the virtual reality and what is not?",
        "agent": "In order for the system to accurately render a virtual reality, it needs to have knowledge of the function and constraints involved. This includes understanding the importance of the function and what would be inside if you were to look. However, it's important to note that virtual reality only describes what is visible and doesn't include hidden elements that are not being measured. The data stream you receive only captures what your eyes and ears are measuring. If something is not being measured or interacted with, it doesn't need to be rendered. The avatar in the virtual reality sets constraints based on the rule set and its evolution. These constraints determine what the consciousness can do with the avatar. For example, if the avatar refuses to follow its intuition because it believes intuition is just guesswork, then that becomes a constraint on its actions."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can the development of our intuitive side help us access valuable information and experiences that may be limited by self-imposed constraints?",
        "agent": "When we feel limited in our consciousness, it's because we have imposed constraints on ourselves. These constraints prevent us from accessing certain information and experiences. This is especially true if we are predominantly left-brained and have focused solely on developing our intellectual abilities. Our intuitive side, which holds valuable insights and knowledge, remains underdeveloped. We haven't taken the time to challenge ourselves, work through confusion, and develop this intuitive part of ourselves. Instead, we have relied on our intellect to organize, categorize, and analyze information, even though it may have been flawed and confused when we were younger. However, with persistence and effort, our intellect has matured, allowing us to make quick and effective judgments. But we have neglected the growth of our intuitive side, which is still at a two or three-year-old stage. To access the information and wisdom stored in our intuitive part, we need to invest time and effort in understanding its connections and working through the confusion."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can we develop our intuitive side to access valuable information and experiences that may be limited by self-imposed constraints?",
        "agent": "I have never gone through the trouble of working through the confusion, understanding what's connected to what, how things work, what the uncertainties are, and why you get this kind of information, and why sometimes it's wrong. All of that stuff has to get worked out. Eventually, my intuitive part can become just as solid, reliable, functional, and useful as my intellectual part. In fact, it's even more functional than my intellectual part because my intuitive side has the big picture. I see that my intellectual side has to sit over here and work intellectually up through little pictures with one step at a time. This makes that reasonable, and that makes the next thing reasonable. It has to chug its way along. On the other hand, my intuitive part has a much bigger picture. It sees my intellectual part, but it sees it from a much higher level, from a much more holistic level than my intellect does. So my intellect is good at slicing and dicing facts in the little picture, while my intuition is good at understanding big concepts and big ideas. Wisdom, or what is connected to what, falls into the bigger picture. Seeing things from a bigger picture, how things relate and interact, all of that is more accessible to my intuitive side. Now, I have both an intuitive side and an intellectual side. It's not a matter of being one or the other. I have both. But what happens is that some of us..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does our culture's emphasis on developing our intellectual side while neglecting our intuitive side hinder our ability to fully tap into our human potential?",
        "agent": "It's not a matter of being one or the other. We all possess both intellectual and intuitive capabilities. However, our culture tends to prioritize the development of our intellectual side while neglecting the nurturing of our intuitive side. This imbalance prevents us from fully realizing our human potential. The aspects of our intuitive side that are overlooked by the intellectual side often get labeled as 'woo woo' or 'paranormal'. The intellectual side dismisses any information that is not obtained through a logical process, simply because it does not align with its own perspective. This narrow-mindedness is a form of arrogance that fails to acknowledge the validity of alternative ways of knowing."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "This  leads us to how you've explained very well how this leads us to the intellect getting in the way of our consciousness exploration. So today I would like you to give some practical examples of how people can develop their intuitive part more, as you've very well stated, the limitations of the intellect. So let's start with remote viewing, with the intuitive side.",
        "agent": "For  some examples, you can do things like remote viewing. That is, you can see what's going on in places other than where you are. And those places don't have to be even on this earth. They can be other places. Any place you see, they're all in the database. And if it's something that the system heavily doesn't deal with, you'll just get probabilities. What is probability like? You see, if there's nothing there that's really established facts, then you'll get probabilities. So any case, that's one remote viewing is just seeing more than what you can see."

        "agent": "Yeah,  it's a really good way to find those keys. Right. It's in the drawer. Right. And you know that right away because you remote view where the keys are. Maybe. It depends. If you're really good at remote viewing, you can actually back out. See, if you just look aware of the keys. I want to see the keys. Well, all you get will be black. You'll just get this black box and you won't see anything. You say, well, I didn't get anything. I just got black. Well, the keys are inside a drawer, and a drawer is shut, and there isn't any light in there. That's why you're getting a black box."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "That  brings me to a good point of remote viewing, and that is the components and seeing or feeling the details of it tell us something about how that works.",
        "agent": "Alright, well, when I remote view, I need to have a clear understanding of what I'm doing. Remote viewing involves accessing data from a database through my intent. For example, if I have the intent to find my car keys, I may not receive any visual information because my keys are in a closed drawer where they cannot be seen. In this case, the absence of an answer is actually the correct answer. However, with practice, I can learn to adjust my perspective and see the bigger picture. Instead of focusing solely on the location of the keys, I can broaden my view and try to visualize where they might be hidden. By doing so, I may be able to perceive a chest of drawers that resembles the one next to my bed. This recognition can then guide me to check those drawers and ultimately find my keys. It's important to understand that remote viewing requires practice and a deep understanding of the process. Throughout our lives, we have been honing our intellectual skills, learning what works and what doesn't. Now, it's time to apply that same dedication to mastering remote viewing."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Have you considered the importance of developing your intuitive side in addition to your intellectual skills? It seems that you have dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to honing your intellect, but your intuitive side may be lacking attention. By developing your intuition, you can gain more control and predictability in your decision-making process. How do you plan to balance the development of both your intellect and intuition?",
        "agent": "I've noticed that you've been dedicating a lot of time and effort to developing your intellect. You've been actively learning and gaining knowledge about what works and what doesn't, as well as different approaches to various situations. However, it seems that you haven't given the same attention to your intuitive side. As a result, you find it confusing and unpredictable, lacking control. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and it can feel strange and unpredictable. The reason behind this is that you haven't taken the time to develop your intuition. It's understandable that this can be problematic and challenging. Just like if you had never developed your intellectual side and someone presented you with a situation that required intellect, you would struggle because you haven't practiced and honed that aspect of yourself. You wouldn't know how to analyze and make sense of things because you haven't learned the different types of analysis and how to apply them effectively. It's the same with intuition. If you haven't spent time honing it, it won't come naturally to you. It's possible that if you're more left-brained, your intuitive side may not have been exercised much, and you may not be as skilled in logical processes. On the other hand, if you're more right-brained, you may have spent more time developing your intuitive side and may excel in that area. It's important to find a balance between both sides of your brain and continue to develop and strengthen both your intellect and intuition."

        "agent": "I have found that when it comes to remote viewing, beginners often struggle with the logical process. It's not a skill that has been exercised much, so it's understandable that they may not be very good at it. In order to improve their chances of success, beginners should try breaking down the task into smaller pieces. For example, if they were looking for their car keys, they could start by considering other details such as the place where the keys might be. Does it have a particular odor? Is it spacious or cramped? What are the colors and feelings associated with that place? By gathering all this information, beginners can better define what they are looking for. This approach is much easier than simply trying to identify a picture without any additional context."

        "questioner": "When trying to understand a complex situation, what factors should you consider in order to create a more complete and vivid mental image?",
        "agent": "When learning and trying to understand a complex situation, it's important to consider all the details and nuances. For example, if we're trying to visualize a scene, we need to think about whether it's a happy scene, if there are people involved, and if everyone is having fun. We can also think about the sounds we hear, like laughter and applause, which might indicate a party or a performance. And let's not forget about the sense of smell, like the aroma of popcorn in a movie theater. By considering all these elements, we can create a more complete and vivid mental image. However, if we were to simply imagine people in a movie theater without any context, our intellect would struggle to fill in the missing information. Our intellect relies on data, and without any data, it would be unable to provide a meaningful interpretation. That's where our intuition comes into play. In situations like remote viewing, for instance, our intuition gathers data that our intellect can't access. The challenge we face is that our intellect tends to dominate, rushing to analyze the data and assign labels to it. It wants to know what's in the box, so to speak. But sometimes, it jumps to conclusions based on limited information. This is where our telepathic skills come in. We all have the ability to communicate telepathically..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do remote viewers overcome the challenge of their intellect interfering with the telepathic communication process? Can you provide some strategies that remote viewers use to keep their intellect from analyzing the data and making assumptions?",
        "agent": "When I use my telepathic skills, I can communicate with other people. It's fascinating how we are all connected in this way. Sometimes, I'll just ask, 'Hey, Joe, are you out there?' and I'll hear Joe respond, 'Yeah, I'm here. What do you want?' But here's the thing, my intellect tends to jump in and question whether I made that up or not. It wants to analyze the data and figure out what's going on. Unfortunately, when my intellect takes over, I lose that connection through intuition. Remote viewers have found ways to keep their intellect out of the process. One method is to remove all information about the subject. For example, if there's something in a box, they try not to see the box itself because even that gives them some clues. They might think, 'Okay, the box isn't any bigger than this, by this, by that, so it must be something about that size.' But that's where the intellect starts analyzing and making assumptions. It might say, 'A horse is too big for the box,' without considering the possibility of a small horse statue. The intellect can really get in the way sometimes, and that's why remote viewers have come up with strategies to overcome this challenge."

        "agent": "You see, the problem with the intellect is that it often gets in the way. That's why remote viewers have come up with a solution to eliminate any interference from the intellect. They use a triple blind method, where three individuals are involved. Let's call them Person A, Person B, and Person C. Person A gathers 10,000 photographs that have clear elements in them. These photographs are carefully selected to ensure there is something significant to observe. Each photograph is then placed in an envelope, randomly shuffled, and numbered from one to 10,000 by Person B. Person C, who is the remote viewer, requests a target to remote view. Using a computer with a random number selector, a number between one and 10,000 is generated. Let's say the number is 1257. Person C then retrieves the envelope labeled with that number and opens it to reveal the corresponding picture."

        "questioner": "Can you explain the process of the triple blind method used by remote viewers to eliminate interference from the intellect during telepathic communication?",
        "agent": "I start with a random number, let's say 1257. This number is then placed in an envelope, which is sealed. The envelope is then passed on to the next person. They take the envelope and approach a remote viewer, without opening it. The person simply informs the remote viewer that there is a number in the envelope that corresponds to a picture, and asks them to describe the picture. This process is what we call triple blind. No one knows what the others have done before. The number in the envelope is randomly chosen from a pool of 10,000 pictures. These pictures are not all the same, so it's not as simple as guessing a rubber duck. The initial person is responsible for selecting a variety of pictures, each with unique elements such as color, shape, landscape, still life, people, children, adults, dogs, cats, horses, and more. The goal is to provide the remote viewer with a diverse set of pictures to describe, without giving them any intellectual cues. Surprisingly, this lack of information actually makes it easier for the remote viewer, not harder."

        "questioner": "How does working in a state with zero data and no prior knowledge or information actually benefit remote viewers in their task?",
        "agent": "When the remote viewer has nothing to engage their intellect, it actually makes their task easier. This is because they prefer to work in a state where their intellect has zero data. It's like a triple blind situation, which is considered good science. In a triple blind scenario, the remote viewer has no prior knowledge or information to influence their perception. For example, if someone tells you there's something in a box and you already know it has to fit in the box, your intellect starts making guesses based on the limited information it has. But these guesses are often wrong because the intellect doesn't have access to the complete database of information. It keeps working on the available information and makes assumptions based on what it knows about the person or the situation. However, remote viewers prefer to work without any preconceived notions or biases, allowing them to tap into a different part of consciousness."

        "questioner": "First  thing that comes to your mind, the right thing, the first impressions.",
        "agent": "Yeah, that's true. And all those other things we talked about. So, yes, it is the first impression that comes because you're querying a database. When you query a database, the database sends you an answer. And that database is very fast. It's a very fast database. So another mistake that people make is they say, well, okay, query the database. I'd like to know what's show me a picture of what's in there, or, I want to get something about what's in that box. Now you get yourself ready, and you relax, and, okay, you're ready. Well, it's already done within a 10th of a second of you saying, I want to see a picture. It was there. And you're still jabbering on about relaxing and doing something else and wanting it. You miss it. It comes immediately. This is just like any other database query. And if your database query is real general, if you say, okay, what's in the box? And you didn't specify what box, you get a random draw from anything. It could be a box anywhere, because all you said is, what's in the box? Terrible query. You see, what's in that box is important. It doesn't guess for you. It doesn't add in stuff to what you ask for. It just gives you what you ask for. So if the guy doing the remote viewing testing has five boxes, and every time you in your mind say, okay, well, I want to know, if you just ask in that situation what's in his box or what's in that box? But you don't really say what you're talking about, and in your mind, it's not clear. Your mind is kind of foggy."

        "questioner": "When conducting remote viewing, how can you ensure that your queries are specific and precise to avoid confusion and obtain accurate results?",
        "agent": "When your language is fuzzy and you don't specify exactly what you want, it can lead to confusion. You might get all five things correct, but in the wrong order because you didn't provide clear instructions. For example, if you ask for 'the box' without specifying which box, you may have a general idea in your mind, but not the specific box you intended. As you go through the boxes, you may end up with one item from each box, but not in the correct order. To avoid this, it's important to be specific and precise in your queries. Additionally, instead of just asking 'what's in the box?', if you're a skilled remote viewer, you can improve your chances of success by asking about the texture or purpose of the items in the box. This additional information can make it easier for you to accurately perceive and interpret the contents."

    {
        "questioner": "When conducting remote viewing, what are some strategies you can employ to gather information about the object in the box beyond its physical appearance? How can you use your senses and surroundings to gain insights into the purpose, emotions, and sensations associated with the object?",
        "agent": "Is it a tool? Or perhaps some kind of tool that is used inside the box? I wonder what color the object in the box is. What are its architectural elements? How would you describe its appearance? It's not just about the object itself, there are other things present that you can interact with. What is the environment like? What emotions or sensations are associated with that object? For instance, it could be a party hat inside the box, or one of those little blowers that make a whistle sound and release a rolling object. In that case, you might hear the sounds of a party and the laughter of children. This would create a happy and festive atmosphere. The object could indeed be a party hat or something related to it. By paying attention to your senses, such as colors, smells, tastes, sizes, and shapes, you can gather all this information and try to understand what the object is used for. Even if the details may not make sense to you at first, when you eventually discover the target, you might realize that many of the things you observed were actually accurate. You may not have specifically mentioned a party hat, but you did mention the presence of a party and the laughter of children. You might have also described the object as having multicolored speckles, and indeed, the party hat could have red, blue, green, and pink little balls on it. So, even though you didn't explicitly say 'party hat,' your observations were quite close to the actual object."

What strategies can you employ to tap into your senses and surroundings to gain insights into the purpose, emotions, and sensations associated with the object?",
        "agent": "So, when I look at the object in the box, I may describe it as having little balls or round things on it. I might mention that it's speckled or provide other details. Even if I don't explicitly say that it's a red, blue, green, speckled party hat, I still gather valuable information about the object. It's not just about naming the thing in the box; it's about gathering information about it. Sometimes, our intellect wants to jump in and just name things without fully understanding them. We might say, 'What is it? I don't get it. Oh, it's a party hat. That's ridiculous.' We might even make excuses based on our past experiences, like going to a birthday party with our kids. But sometimes, we quickly dismiss things without giving them a chance. We throw them away in milliseconds, without even processing them fully. This can be a problem because our intellect can get in the way of what we're doing. Now, let's talk about dreams. In regular dreams, not lucid dreams, we make choices from our intuitive side, which I often refer to as our being level. It's the core of who we are..."

        "questioner": "How does our intuitive side, or what you refer to as our being level, influence our decision-making in both dreams and everyday life? Can you explain the role of intuition in our interactions with others and how it can provide valuable information?",
        "agent": "I often refer to your intuitive side as your being level. It is the core of who you are, defining your true self. On the other hand, your intellect represents your image, how you perceive yourself and what you aspire to be. Your intellect is often influenced by ego and beliefs, unlike your core self which remains unchanged. In normal dreams, the choices you make are a direct reflection of your being level, your intuitive part. This is fascinating because it shows that we constantly rely on our intuitive side, not just in dreaming but also in our everyday lives. We trust our hunches, gut feelings, and vibes when interacting with others. Sometimes, we instantly like or dislike someone without any logical reason. These feelings are not based on new age concepts like vibes, but rather on the information we receive from our intuitive side. However, if you haven't developed your intuitive side, you may not fully understand or utilize this valuable source of information."

    {
        "questioner": "How can dismissing or ignoring your intuitive side lead to regret later on, and why is it important to differentiate between intuition and guesses based on probabilities?",
        "agent": "When it comes to getting information from your intuitive side, if you haven't developed it, you tend to dismiss it and not pay much attention. You might think it's silly and ignore it. However, later on, you often realize that your intuition was actually giving you the right information. It's like a first impression that you should have trusted. You might say to yourself, 'Oh, I should have listened to my intuition, I messed up.' The thing is, your intuition doesn't always give you the information at the moment. It's not like a gut feeling or a guess from your intellect. Your intellect might analyze the situation and make a guess based on probabilities, but that's not the same as intuition. So, don't confuse the two and claim that your intuition is unreliable. It's mostly your intellect that sometimes gets confused."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "And  how can we develop a way to recognize more when that intellect jumps in?",
        "agent": "Well, it's quite challenging because if you are a left brain dominant person, your intellect governs your life. It influences every aspect of your existence. In such a case, you may not even be aware of your intuitive side. You might not recognize it even if it's right in front of you. You simply don't pay attention to it. Consequently, it becomes nearly impossible for you to discern the difference between the two. You either downplay or dismiss any non-intellectual experiences, making it difficult to grasp the concept. It's challenging to show you the distinction because you don't acknowledge its existence or its reliability. You may not believe that it's something you can learn and improve with practice. This confusion often arises. However, let me provide you with a couple of examples that occur at the being level. Interestingly, any complex task that requires precision, multiple steps, or well-trained responses is best performed at the being level. The intellect tends to second-guess and constantly judge and assess. Take touch typing, for instance. When you learn touch typing, you no longer need to look at your fingers..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the process of becoming a skilled touch typist and how it goes beyond relying solely on your intellect?",
        "agent": "When you learn touch typing, it means you don't look at where your fingers are. It's not just about memorizing the key positions. Eventually, you have to go beyond your intellect. Your intellect tells you which finger is responsible for each key. You mechanically go through the process, reading sentences like 'the brown dog jumps over the lazy fox' that contain all the letters of the alphabet. But if you're still looking at each word and figuring out where to place your fingers, you're relying on your intellect to solve the problem. However, you'll never become proficient at typing if you rely solely on your intellect. The key is to reach a point where you no longer think about which finger should hit which key, and instead, let your fingers instinctively hit the right keys. That's when you become a skilled touch typist, capable of typing at a speed of around 60 words per minute, compared to just five or ten words per minute if you're still searching for each key. Typing slowly and using only two fingers is a result of having to look for each key and deliberately press it. Instead, let your fingers..."

        "questioner": "In various domains, relying on intuition rather than intellect seems to be crucial for achieving proficiency. Can you provide an example from your own experience where letting go of your intellect and trusting your instincts has been essential to excel in a particular skill?",
        "agent": "When it comes to performing any skill, whether it's playing an instrument or throwing a javelin, there's a point where you have to let go of your intellect and rely on your intuition. As an athlete, I've learned that 80% of winning is mental. It's about getting out of your head and allowing your body to do what it knows how to do. Take throwing a javelin, for example. If you're constantly thinking about the mechanics and the steps, you'll never excel. You have to reach a level where you just trust your instincts and throw it. The same goes for playing an instrument. At first, you have to think about every note and where your fingers should go. But with practice, it becomes second nature. You read the music, and your hands automatically go where they need to go. It's a beautiful blend of intuition and skill. I remember having a talented painter in my house once. He would effortlessly paint the intricate woodwork between the windows, without even thinking about it..."

        "questioner": "Can you share an experience where you witnessed someone with exceptional skill and precision in their craft, relying on their intuition rather than overthinking and analyzing every step?",
        "agent": "I remember this one time when I watched a painter at work. He was incredibly skilled and meticulous. He would carefully paint the little woodwork between the window panes, dipping his brush and making precise strokes. It was fascinating to see how he managed to paint only the wood and not a single molecule of glass. He had this innate ability to put paint exactly where he wanted it, without any second-guessing or overthinking. Unlike someone who relies on their intellect, he didn't need to analyze or worry about making mistakes. He was in the zone, just like a javelin thrower who can only succeed when their mind is in the right space. It's not about intellectualizing the process, but about achieving the desired result and knowing it's done well when it feels right."

    {
        "questioner": "In what situations is it crucial to tap into your intuitive side rather than relying solely on your intellect? Can you provide examples where relying on intuition has led to exceptional outcomes?",
        "agent": "You know you've done it well when it feels right, not when your intellect has decided that you made all the right moves, but when it really feels right, it's a feeling you've done it right. That's the painters in the zone. The athlete has to get in the zone. That's why when an athlete gets out to go, he's not talking on his cell phone, selling stocks and talking to these kids and then closes the cell phone, grabs these giant, and throws it. That won't work. He's got to get his head into the right mind space, where he's out of the intellect, into the intuitive side. You have to stay focused in that space, get in the zone and stay. So anything athletics, no matter what you're doing, you have to be able to get out of your intellect and do it well. And I say anything. I mean anything complex, anything has a lot of parts in it, because your intellect cannot correlate a lot of parts very quickly. Your intellect isn't that quick, but intuitively, you can correlate all those parts perfectly. It's a matter of what do they call muscle memory if you're an athlete? But it's not just muscle memory. It is an intuitive space. You can have all the muscle memory because you've practiced for thousands of hours and get up there and have a terrible day. That terrible day is because your mind wasn't in the right place. So this intuitive side is really very powerful. It can do all kinds of things your intellect can't do. It puts you in the zone for all sorts of things. When you're solving a problem, you have to tap into that intuitive side, because the real world is not accurately modeled by continuous functions. It's too complex for that. You need that intuitive understanding to navigate through the complexities and find the best solutions."

        "agent": "When I'm solving a problem, I become a mathematician, engaging in logical and left-brain work. However, there are moments when I reach a point where I can't see the next step. No matter how much I push and analyze, the solution eludes me. It's in those moments that I take a deep breath, close my eyes, and let go of the problem. And just like magic, the next step reveals itself. This is where intuition comes into play, even for technical individuals who heavily rely on their logical thinking. Intuition is the realm where true art is created. It's not about technique or following a set of rules; it's about expressing emotions and feelings through an instrument or any other form of art. Intuition is the driving force behind all artistic endeavors. We often underestimate the power of intuition, but it's the source of all creativity. Similarly, many scientific breakthroughs and 'AHA' moments occur when we're not actively using our intellect. It's when we're relaxed, open, and receptive that the answers come to us. So, while we may think that intuition is separate from intellect, it's actually the wellspring from which all art and innovation flow."

        "agent": "I've been working on it, I have the question, how does that work? What's that next step? But I'm not trying to push it. I just have that in my mind and I'm relaxed and poof. There's the answer. You see, as a novelist, I get my plots and my stories intuitively. I'm not intellectually doing all of that. A lot of it's an intuitive process. Intellectually, I have to make coherent sentences that have all the verbs and nouns and everything else in the right place, in the right tense, at the right time. But that's the mechanics of it. The creative part of it is mostly intuitive, what feels right, what feels good. And that's true of everything we do. So if we really discount that intuitive part, we'd be uncoordinated slobs who couldn't think up anything new. You see, that intuitive part is really important to us, but yet we never take the time to develop it, to hone it, to understand how it works, to make it reliable. But we use it all the time, whether we're a doctor, a lawyer, an Indian chief, a mathematician, or whatever. We get that kind of spark of knowledge, of inspiration that just comes in a lump from our intuition. And the same way it is about people. If we interact with people, our intuition tells us about that person and what they're feeling and what they're thinking and the kind of person there is that comes right to us."

If you search for 'remote viewing targets' on Google, you will discover several websites that offer free target sites. These sites provide you with a number, and your task is to remote view what that number represents, such as a picture. You can document your observations, including the smell, texture, color, and overall appearance. Once you have recorded your impressions, you can enter the number on the website, and it will reveal the corresponding picture. By comparing your drawing and notes with the actual image, you can assess the accuracy of your remote viewing abilities. Initially, your intellect might interfere and hinder your performance. However, there may be instances where you surprise yourself and accurately perceive the target. In such cases, it is essential to reflect on what you did differently.

By trying different approaches, analyzing what works and what doesn't, and understanding the mental state required, you can eventually train your intuition to remote view. Let me share an interesting story about a guy I knew who was taking a course on developing intuition. He had five plastic drinking cups, each of a different color - yellow, green, blue, red, and maybe even an orange one. He also had matching balls, similar to tennis balls but smaller, in the same colors. To make things more challenging, he would wear a sleep mask that completely blocked out any light. This wasn't just a simple bandana, but a large mask that covered his entire face, with soft foam rubber to ensure complete darkness. With the cups placed in front of him, someone would rearrange them while he couldn't see. Then, they would hand him a ball, and he would have to drop it into the cup that matched its color..."

There was a teacher who had mastered the art of quickly placing colored balls into corresponding cups. It was evident that he had been practicing this skill for a considerable amount of time. As I handed him the balls, he effortlessly dropped each one into the cup of the same color. His hand moved with such speed and precision that it seemed almost instinctual. Intrigued, I asked him how he knew which cup to put each ball in. He replied, 'I don't know consciously. My hand and arm just know where to go.' He compared it to typing, explaining that he doesn't think about the location of each letter on the keyboard when he types. Instead, his hand intuitively moves to the right keys as he reads the text on the screen. It's a state of being in the zone, where intuition takes over. I witnessed him flawlessly place ten balls in a row, each within half a second, without relying on logical reasoning. It was clear that his intellect wasn't guiding his actions based on patterns or predictions.'"

        "agent": "Well, when I'm doing this exercise, I don't overthink it. I simply put in the yellow, green, and red balls, and then I know the next one is probably blue. It's not about my intellect assessing the situation, it's more about letting my arm and hand go wherever they need to go. It's a bit different from typing because the keys don't move around on the keyboard. But with this exercise, it's a little harder because the cups can be shuffled around. Maybe if I had a designated spot for each colored cup, it would be more like typing. But regardless, it's an exercise that I can do. Instead of trying to guess where the ball goes, I just put it where it seems like it goes and then feel the difference between when it works and when it doesn't. I do more of what works and less of what doesn't work. Over time, I develop my intuition as a reliable tool that I can depend on. It's not something flaky that only works sometimes. It's me who can sometimes get into the right mind state and sometimes can't. But when I am in that right state, when my intellect is quiet, it just works.

My mind becomes scattered, overwhelmed by the emotional turmoil and distractions in my life. Consequently, I may struggle to utilize my intuition effectively. The issue lies not with the reliability of my intuition but with my own fluctuating mindsets, moods, and attitudes. These variables make it problematic at times, leading to moments when I feel incapable of accessing my intuition. It's crucial to recognize that the problem lies within me, not with my intuition. Even if I have a lot going on in my life, I can still learn to enter that intuitive state and make it work consistently. Cultivating and maintaining that state is the key.

Imagine a humanoid figure, and let's say that everything white represents a healthy condition, while anything dark indicates a problem. Now, let's take Susie Q as an example. We create a gingerbread cookie outline that represents her, and when we focus our intentions on her, we notice a dark spot right at her stomach. Ah, it seems like she has some kind of stomach issue. The beauty of this approach is that we can refine our queries and zoom in or out for more detailed or broader information. We can even examine individual cells if we know what we're looking for. It's all about asking for different levels of detail, and the databases have it all. We can request information on a molecular level, a cellular level, or just a top-level overview. And the best part is, we don't have to rely solely on visuals. We can use graphs too! For example, we can plot health on one axis and time on the other, with zero representing death and 100% representing perfect health. By observing how the graph changes over time, we can predict how someone's health will evolve in the next ten years, one year at a time. It's fascinating to watch the graph unfold..."

We can communicate with beings who are currently alive and participating in this game we call life. And we can also communicate with beings who have passed away and are now in a different realm. When we communicate with the deceased, we are actually accessing the data that was recorded about them when they were alive. It's like tapping into their life story. Developing and honing our intuition is key to accessing this information. However, it's not something that happens overnight. Just like it took years or even decades to develop our intellect, our intuition also requires time and practice to reach its full potential. But the effort is worth it because when our intellect and intuition work together harmoniously, we become whole. Our intellect analyzes and organizes the data, while our intuition fills in the gaps and provides a deeper understanding. This integration allows us to access a complete picture of reality.

Whether it's a javelin thrower feeling the perfect moment or a painter being in the Zone, these experiences cannot be measured objectively. The Zone is a mental state, and mental states are subjective and immeasurable. In addition to the objective world, there is also a subjective world that follows its own scientific principles.

It's when these data streams interact and reorganize themselves based on their unique value that you become a complete person, rather than just a fraction of yourself. Living solely in the realm of intellect can be limiting, as it often involves suppressing emotions and feelings due to their subjective nature. Emotions and feelings are often seen as illusions because they cannot be objectively measured. However, by embracing both logic and intuition, you can tap into a more powerful and well-rounded version of yourself, much like the dynamic duo of Spock and Captain Kirk. Spock, with his logical prowess, was clever and fast, but limited. It was Captain Kirk, with his intuition and logic, who ultimately saved the day. Their success stemmed from the synergy of both logic and intuition working together as a team. Similarly, by nurturing both your left brain (logical) and right brain (intuitive) capabilities, you can enhance your relationships and navigate the intuitive space with ease."

        "agent": "Well, relationships are mostly in the intuitive space. In the intuitive space, you feel things. When you engage in remote viewing, you experience the ambience and atmosphere. It's like being at a party, wearing a party hat, surrounded by vibrant colors. You see, it's all about feeling. It's not a matter of your intuition telling you to move your hand up, move it out, move it over, stop, or open your hand. It's about what feels right, and that feeling is accurate. So, to truly understand relationships, you have to tap into the feeling space. If you primarily rely on your left brain and logical thinking, you may not have a strong connection to your feelings. Sure, you have feelings, but they might be a jumbled mess that you struggle to differentiate and utilize. You might even suppress them. However, if you develop your ability to work with and trust your feelings, you'll be able to make decisions based on what feels right. This applies to relationships as well. Relationships thrive in the realm of feelings, not logic. So, if you find yourself struggling with relationships, it's likely because you're too focused on logic and not enough on feelings. We delve deeper into this topic in..."

        "agent": "I used to think that everything could be explained through logic and reason. But I've come to realize that relationships are not governed by logic alone. They are deeply intertwined with our emotions and feelings. It's in that intuitive space where the true essence of relationships lies. Some may argue that this intuitive space is unreliable and doesn't even exist. However, by dismissing it, we are neglecting a crucial aspect of our lives. The objective and logical aspects may be real, but they are not the only things that matter. The most important aspects of life are the intangible ones - the relationships we build, the care we show, and the emotions we experience. It's about how happy and satisfied we are, how much peace we bring into the world, and how we connect with others. This feeling space opens up a whole new world to us, a world of intuition and understanding. It's a balance between the left brain and the right brain. If we are too focused on logic, we miss out on the richness of life. On the other hand, if we are solely driven by emotions, we may struggle to comprehend and articulate our experiences. It's important to acknowledge and embrace both aspects, as they work together to shape our understanding of the world. So, let's not dismiss those who rely on their intuition as airheads. Instead, let's recognize the value of their unique perspective and the insights they bring."

        "agent": "I don't need to explain how it happens. I just know. People who rely solely on their left brain dismiss those who possess intuitive abilities as airheads because they can't rationalize or explain their experiences. However, if you have both intellect and intuition, you can understand and explain it. There is a science, logic, and structure to the intuitive world, but you have to cultivate and develop it. Once you do, you'll comprehend how you receive intuitive information and why. It requires knowledge of databases, queries, and how to effectively retrieve information. You also need to learn how to quiet your intellect and let your intuition guide you. As for how I receive data, it's because that information exists in the database as a probable future. Currently, the probability of that future is around 0.7. Anyone can tap into this intuitive side and cultivate their emotional awareness. It's what brings richness and meaning to life. It's where peace, happiness, and satisfaction originate. These are all emotions that arise from the realm of feelings. Otherwise, you'll be a robotic intellectual who relies solely on logic and reasoning. While you may be clever, there will always be something missing in your life. You won't truly connect with people or experience meaningful relationships. It's a shallow and unfulfilling existence."

        "questioner": "Thank  you, Tom. This is a good argument and good examples of how a balanced brain can bring you a richer life.",
        "agent": "But  it's not a balanced brain. It's a balanced consciousness, balanced conscious. That brain has really nothing to do with it. It's a virtual brain. It's a balanced consciousness can lead to a very rewarding life. And without that balance, you are one dimensional and one dimensional. People are really good at solving logical problems, but they're not very good at living a life. They're not very good at relationship. They're not very good at finding happiness and finding satisfaction in their life. Their satisfaction is always solving the next problem, doing clever things. But that doesn't leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling that a good relationship leaves you with, or that fulfillment. It's all kind of sterile compared to the feeling side. So yeah, it's not a brain. We call left brain, right brain. But I said we're using that as a metaphor. Of course, those are metaphors for certain things that consciousness can do. It's not really about right brains and left brains. Brains are irrelevant. We're talking about consciousness and that right brain. Left brain is a metaphor for two different ways of approaching processing information and ways of kind of opening yourself up to all the information, not just one side of it or one slice of it."
