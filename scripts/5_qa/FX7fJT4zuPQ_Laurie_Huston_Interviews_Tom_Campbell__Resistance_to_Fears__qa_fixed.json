This is News for the Heart and today, as it is the last Tuesday of the month, which you will see probably within the next week or so, at least the video, the audio will be up as quickly as possible, but we have Tom Campbell with me now. Tom is one of my favorite guests, host, co hosts, because we get to talk about a lot of his theories and bring them into the you know, Tom has so much information out there and it attracts so many different types of people. A lot of my work know for those people that know, want to dig deep, and a lot of times that's just the women. But Tom reaches a different market because he really goes into some of the interesting paranormal things and his theories and the trilogies of books that he wrote, which is my big toe theory of everything. You can find out a lot of what Tom does by looking at his YouTube station, which has hundreds of videos and probably thousands of hours, right?",
        "agent": "Yes."

        "questioner": "Today, let's delve into the concept of resistance. Resistance occurs when we set intentions and get clear on what we want, but end up focusing on all the things we don't want. This becomes problematic because we tend to look at the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause or fear. For example, when it comes to our health, instead of identifying the deeper fear or subconscious fear, we focus on the symptoms. The same goes for weight and abundance. We say we want to lose weight or have abundance, but then we fixate on the factors causing the problem or the bills that need to be paid. These hidden fears distract us from addressing the root issues. Additionally, we need to explore the process of letting go and releasing the intensity of our emotions. Often, when we feel uncomfortable, we seek distractions and fall into addictive behaviors that are rooted in our fears and choices. By tying all these aspects together, we can gain a better understanding of how to move forward.",
        "agent": "Okay, as I listen to you, I've considered several different approaches. The last one that came to mind is the connection between causes and symptoms, which is also tied to the distinction between doing and being. When we encounter a problem like weight, health, or abundance, we often think about what actions we can take to address it. We search for a solution, thinking that if we just follow a specific prescription, such as cutting out junk food, snacks, and opting for healthier, organic options, everything will be fine. We focus on the doing, but the real issue lies elsewhere. It's not that we fail to do what's healthy or beneficial for us; it's that there's a deeper reason why we don't take those actions. You see, the problem lies in our being, not in our doing. We engage in behaviors that aren't good for us, like neglecting exercise or indulging in snacks and desserts, despite knowing we shouldn't. It's not solely because our actions are incorrect; they are merely the final link in a chain of events. The root of the problem lies in our being. Once we address and rectify our being at its core, our actions naturally fall into place. Instead of fixating on external factors or actions, we should focus on cultivating a positive and authentic sense of self."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When it comes to addressing the root causes of our behaviors and actions, what is the importance of shifting our focus from external factors and actions to understanding our intentions and motivations at a deeper level?",
        "agent": "Instead of fixating on the actions and the external aspects of life, it is crucial to shift our focus towards understanding our intentions. Rather than constantly asking ourselves what we should do, we should delve into the reasons behind our actions. It is not about questioning why we fail to do what we should do, but rather understanding why we do what we do. You see, when we truly comprehend the underlying motivations at the core of our being, we gain a deeper understanding of ourselves. However, one of the challenges we face when exploring our being level is the uncertainty of our own identity. We often find ourselves pondering, 'Who am I at the being level?' In response, we tend to list various roles and responsibilities that define us in the external world. We identify ourselves as mothers, sisters, and so on, but we overlook our true essence at the being level. In fact, we often mask our authentic selves with the image of who we aspire to be. We conform to societal expectations, believing that we should always wear a smile and exude cheerfulness. We put on a facade of happiness, even when we don't genuinely feel it. This is because we believe it is the right way to behave. However, as we go through life, constantly acting in accordance with our perceived ideals and focusing on what we should do, we find ourselves unable to consistently align our actions with our intentions. It is always our actual actions that take precedence over our intentions. This occurs because our actions are influenced by our thoughts, emotions, external circumstances, and subconscious biases."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Why is it important to shift our focus from external factors and actions to understanding our intentions and motivations at a deeper level?",
        "agent": "It is always the actions that take precedence in one's life. These actions are a reflection of who we are at our core. Many people struggle with understanding their true selves because they have been so focused on their external actions, relationships, and connections. They fail to recognize that they have played a role in creating these situations and often see themselves as mere victims. However, we need to adopt a new perspective on our existence. It is not just about achieving specific goals like losing weight or exercising regularly; those are just surface-level outcomes. Instead, we should delve deeper and ask ourselves why we do what we do. Without understanding the underlying motivations, it will be challenging to make lasting changes because we will inevitably revert to our old patterns. Trying to be someone we are not is not the solution. The key is to transform ourselves from within. If we find that our lives lack joy or do not align with our desires, or if we struggle with weight issues, it is crucial to delve deep into our motivations and beliefs to uncover the root causes and make meaningful changes."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "If you find yourself dissatisfied with your current life situation, what should you focus on in order to make lasting changes and achieve your desired state?",
        "agent": "I understand that you may feel dissatisfied with your current life situation, whether it's lacking joy, feeling heavy, being poor, or experiencing loneliness. Instead of simply trying to do something different or change external circumstances, it's important to reflect on why you are the way you are and whether it aligns with your desired state. If you realize that you want to be different, the key lies in transforming your inner self rather than solely relying on external actions. This shift in focus requires a deeper exploration of your beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Let  me understand. Okay, so from a being level, instead of what I'm doing from a being level is distracting myself because I don't want to face certain emotions or feel that those emotions are going to be too turbulent or too much or whatever it is that we do. And then we addict ourselves with certain things that will not necessarily make us feel better, but maybe make us feel better for a very short period of time, or they used to make us feel better. So we kind of sort of still do those things. So the being aspect then, is that we're avoiding that. We are resisting that. We're distracting ourselves.",
        "agent": "Yes, right. The reason we seek distractions is rooted in fear. We hesitate to confront our true selves at the being level because we anticipate an unpleasant image. We fear that we will discover our inadequacies and deviate from our desired state. Instead of facing this potential ugliness, we construct a narrative. I believe you refer to it as 'telling ourselves a story.' We embrace this story as our identity, but it is merely a fabrication. It does not truly represent who we are. To initiate change at the being level, courage is paramount. One must genuinely acknowledge their current state and essence, separate from the story. Acceptance of the present condition is crucial, not in the sense of resigning oneself to it indefinitely, but in recognizing the starting point. Only by honestly examining our being can we address the detrimental habits and aspects of our lives. Without this introspection, lasting transformations in relationships, weight, or any other aspect will remain elusive. Temporary changes may occur for a month, two months, or even six months, but true and lasting change requires a deep understanding and commitment to personal growth."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "To achieve lasting personal change, where should one begin and what is the key factor that determines whether the change will be temporary or permanent?",
        "agent": "I believe that personal change is not a permanent state. It may seem like you can alter things for a short period of time, maybe a month or even six months, but eventually, everything reverts back to its original state. This is simply the way things are. It's the way you are. It's your narrative. To truly make a lasting change, you must start from the core and work your way up. You can't begin at the surface level, where you're merely trying to fix the story you believe in, because that story isn't real. And what's real will always bring you back to that same old story you're trying to escape from. You see, that's the real you. So, you need to dig deep and uncover the true essence of who you are. Everything else is just a way for you to cope with the fear that lies beneath. Fear is at the very root of it all. You fear that you're not a good person, that you're not likable, that you're not enough. These fears reside within you, and you don't want to confront them, do you? That's the fundamental issue. You need to acknowledge and accept who you truly are. Once you have a clear understanding of your true self, then you have the power to make changes. But until you reach that level of self-awareness, it's incredibly challenging to alter anything because you're stuck in that state. It's like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic - all the effort you put into it doesn't really matter in the end because it's all just part of the story. It's all just a game you're playing, and it doesn't provide a long-lasting solution. It's all temporary, and true change can only come from a deeper understanding and transformation of oneself."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What is the key to achieving lasting personal change and how can one align their actions with their true desires to make changes that feel authentic and effortless?",
        "agent": "I believe that life is more than just a game that we pretend to play. It's not about temporary fixes or forcing things with our intellect. Instead, it's about being true to ourselves and embracing who we are. If we want to make changes, we should start at the core of our being and align our actions with our true desires. When we do that, we'll find that the things that used to be difficult, like losing weight or maintaining relationships, become easier. They no longer feel like a struggle because they are aligned with our authentic selves. It's not about following a story or what we think we should do; it's about genuinely wanting to make those changes."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "But  you want the root cause is which is usually a safety issue or we learned a silly behavior because our parents would reward us with food to be good. So whenever we don't feel good, we reward ourselves to be with food in hopes to be good. Right? It's like those unconscious fears that we have that we're just not conscious of.",
        "agent": "A lot of times, I find that I have various strategies in dealing with these fears. One of the most common strategies is a little game that goes like this: 'I can't lose if I don't play.' You see, I fear that if I try to play, I'll lose and not do well. So, 'I can't lose if I don't play' becomes a strategy to avoid facing the fear of losing. But the truth is, if I don't play, I lose. I always lose if I don't play. This is often why people struggle with weight issues. There's this very stressful game called male-female interaction, husband-wife interaction, girlfriend-boyfriend interaction, and it's filled with stress. If I feel insecure, one of my strategies is to not play. I say to myself, 'I can't lose, I won't be rejected.' And how do I not play? I cut off my hair real short, I gain weight, I take on other things. I convince myself that if I get rejected, it's not because of who I am, but because of external factors like my weight or appearance. I create this illusion that it's not really me being rejected. But the truth is, if I just tried and got rejected, that would be awful, that would be losing. So, I choose not to play, and the rejection I get is not really focused on me, but on this protective shield I've built around myself."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the connection between the fear of losing and the strategy of not playing? How does this strategy manifest in different aspects of life, such as male-female interaction or weight issues?",
        "agent": "But if I don't play, then the rejection I get is not really focused on me. It's focused on this character that I am, this heavy person that is no longer in the game. So that's why I don't get called or whatever because I've taken myself out of the game. But that's okay, that's my choice. That's not a rejection, you see. So now let's explore one of the ways to discover something, like eating. If I can't solve the problem of letting go of that strategy that's attached to that fear, then yes, I can diet, I can do all kinds of things, but I'll continually sabotage myself because that's not really what I want to do. I need that weight. I need that weight. Otherwise, I'd have other choices to make that are scary, too scary, you see? So that's a strategy, and we use that strategy along with many others to deal with our fears. Let's imagine we're 20 years old and 60 pounds overweight, but we're safe from rejection. We try to diet, but it just doesn't work. And for some reason, in the middle of that diet, there's this big tub of pistachio ice cream that we just can't leave alone. And we'll say, okay, well, I'll just do that, and then I'll be good again. But it all eventually unravels, and it doesn't work. And then we start feeling bad about ourselves. Oh, I guess I can't lose this weight. There's nothing really wrong with me, you see, deep inside. It's just a matter of finding the right approach and staying committed to it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Have you experienced any challenges or frustrations when it comes to losing weight? What methods have you tried so far, and what are your thoughts on the effectiveness of those approaches?",
        "agent": "Well, when it comes to losing weight, I've been struggling. It's frustrating because I can't seem to shed those extra pounds. I've tried various diets and exercise routines, but nothing seems to work. It's not like there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Deep down, I know that. But this weight just won't budge. I keep telling myself different stories to justify it. Maybe it's my metabolism, or perhaps it's a hormonal imbalance. I've even considered that it could be my thyroid causing the problem. Whatever the reason, it's clear that I can't lose this weight."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Genetic.",
        "agent": "Yeah, it's genetic. And I have all of these reasons why. And as I try to lose it, I just can't, because at a deeper level, I have that weight for a reason, and that reason is a strategy to deal with a fear. So, you see, until I get back to the who am I? Oh, I see. I'm really afraid of this, and that's why I've kind of taken myself out of the game, and I need to deal with that fear, accept that fear. All right, I get rejected. That's okay. That's not so much about me as it is about the person rejecting me. You see, I just see things and accept things and take responsibility. Now, that weight can just fall off because I don't need it anymore. So there's things like that that we need. We need poor relationships sometimes just because it makes us feel, oh, I don't know. It's not necessarily the martyr game. That's another strategy. You see, that's a different strategy. But sometimes the poor relationship, the struggling relationship that I am always getting picked on, and I feel myself to be the pawn or the victim. Well, I need that feeling of being a pawn and a victim, because that helps me deal with fear that I have if I were not to be that pawn and victim, if I were to be out there in charge and responsible. But what if that didn't work? What if that was a failure? Oh, well, the pawn and the victim, I can get a little sympathy, and it's really never my problem. It's not my fault, you see, because I'm just this pawn. I'm a victim. It's not my fault."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In what ways do our fears influence the decisions we make in life, and how do these decisions become part of the narratives we create for ourselves?",
        "agent": "It's not my fault, you see. I'm just a pawn, a victim of circumstances. These obstacles, tied to our fears, hinder our progress and prevent us from truly understanding ourselves. We spend our lives clinging to these narratives, never embracing our authenticity. We constantly struggle, often with ourselves, refusing to confront life head-on. We crave control and safety, seeking refuge in familiar patterns. For instance, if you're a young woman plagued by the fear of inadequacy, dropping out of a high-stress game may temporarily alleviate that intellectual anxiety. Similarly, career choices can be influenced by the same underlying fears. Perhaps you aspire to be a doctor, but the fear of not getting into medical school leads you to settle for being a nurse. These decisions are rooted in fear, not just practicality or necessity. They become our stories, justifications for the strategies we adopt to cope with our fears. But it's important to recognize that these stories are not absolute truths. They are beliefs we hold onto, excuses for the paths we've taken, shaping our perceptions and influencing our actions."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What is the underlying issue that causes us to justify our actions and behaviors, and how can exploring our subconscious motivations help us understand why we engage in certain behaviors?",
        "agent": "I believe that things happen the way they do because it allows us to justify our actions and behaviors. It's possible that I may be confusing some people with my explanation, but the underlying issue is that you are correct. The problem we think we have is not the actual problem. We often believe that overeating is the problem, but it is merely a symptom of a deeper issue. The real problem lies in our fears. Why do we feel the need to be overweight? That is the question we should be asking ourselves. You might argue that you don't want to be heavy, that you want to be thin. However, that desire is coming from your rational mind. To truly understand why you engage in certain behaviors, you need to explore your subconscious motivations."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "It,  because you're always getting something out of all of our stories, right?",
        "agent": "Yes, that's correct. These stories serve as a means for us to overcome our fear of COVID, effectively making the fear vanish. It's a way for us to hide our fear, pretending it doesn't exist. We create narratives to explain our lives, our identities, and the events that happen to us. However, these stories prevent us from truly understanding our authentic selves. Therefore, it becomes essential for most of us to embark on a journey of self-discovery, peeling away the layers of intellect and embracing our true being. This process requires courage and is a gradual one. It's not like waking up one morning and being a completely different person from the night before. It takes years of dedication because these fears are genuinely terrifying. We are genuinely afraid, and that fear can drive us to make any excuse to avoid facing it. We might say, 'I'll do it tomorrow,' or 'It's not really necessary anyway, so I don't have to do this.' We come up with various excuses. It's similar to being an addict, like an alcoholic who rationalizes having 'just one drink.' They convince themselves that it won't cause any harm. They find an excuse to do what they want to do. And ultimately, these excuses prevent us from taking the necessary actions and hinder our progress."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When it comes to making excuses and avoiding facing our fears, can you provide an example of a situation where you found yourself rationalizing your actions or making excuses to avoid confronting your fears?",
        "agent": "I'm not going to drink this one. You see? And I come up with an excuse to do what it is that I want to do. And with food, it's the same way. Well, I'll just eat this one thing or I'll just buy these cookies or I'll just have some sugar when I know I shouldn't have sugar. And it's because there's a part of me that says, of course I want that sugar. Yes, I do want to be heavy. Yes, being a martyr, being a poor little me is a good excuse for me not being more of what I should be."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "There are many layers to our emotions, and sometimes we hide certain emotions because they are too intense for us. Guilt is one of the biggest emotions that we tend to avoid because it carries a heavy energy. I recently experienced credit card fraud, and even though it wasn't my fault, I felt guilty and worried about how others would perceive me. Our minds don't want us to have multiple compartments for guilt, so it's important to identify the initial guilt and understand where it takes us. Guilt can be a heavy burden to carry.",
        "agent": "Sure, yeah. You have your underlying fear, your basic fears. Things like people won't like me or people will think bad of me. Abandonment, I'm not good enough, I'm inadequate. You have all these very fundamental fears, but these fundamental fears then branch off and create more fears, and those fears create more fears. And it just keeps building out layer by layer. And pretty soon you have so many fears all stacked up. Of course, they all go back to that basic fear of abandonment or not being good enough or something like that. That's the root of it all. But they've built up to this set of fears that becomes your life. And when you feel guilty, that's another fear. So why do you feel guilty? Well, you feel guilty because there's a lot of merchants that are going to be stuck with bills that had my name on them because somebody stole my credit stuff and they're going to think badly of me, you see. And, oh, no, you see, they will think and my name will be on the bad list in their shop. And what if I go in there one day and they recognize my name? I'm the one that ripped them off. But you have this sense of what other people think of me, you see. Well, what other people think of me is only a concern if you feel inadequate, if you feel inadequate, if you're okay about yourself, you don't really care that much what other people think of you. What other people think of you is their issue, not your issue. You see? Your issue is what do you think of yourself? Their issue is what do they think of you."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you overcome the burden of guilt and the fear of how others perceive you? What steps can you take to focus on your own self-acceptance and let go of the opinions of others?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you something. The issue here is not your issue. It's their issue. You see? Your issue is all about what you think of yourself. But their issue is all about what they think of you. And guess what? There's nothing you can do about that. So here's what you do: you just live your life. Let the chips fall where they may. And if there are some people out there who don't like you for whatever reason, whether it's a misunderstanding or something else, well, that's just the way it is. You accept it. You see, it's okay. And when you're okay with yourself, then everything else falls into place. However it turns out, it's fine. But here's the thing, my friend. When you're not okay with yourself, that's when you start feeling guilty. That's when you start carrying all these problems with you. And you know what? They all trace back to some deep-rooted fear. It could be something you've been carrying around since you were born or shortly thereafter. It's that kind of thing. And let me tell you, finding that fear is not easy. It's like peeling back layers upon layers until you finally get to the core fear. It's a journey, my friend. But you know what's interesting? While fear may be hard to find, ego is a piece of cake. Ego is what drives you. It's what shapes your intentions and motivations. It's what makes you feel the way you feel. And you know what? It's easy to spot. Just ask yourself, is it all about me? Is it about how I feel? If the answer is yes, then it's about you. It's not really about those people and what they think of you. It's about your own insecurities and fears. So, my friend, let go of that ego and embrace yourself. Accept who you are, flaws and all. Because when you do, you'll find that the opinions of others don't matter as much. You'll find peace within yourself, and that's what truly matters."

    {
        "questioner": "How can you cultivate self-confidence and prioritize your own self-worth, disregarding the opinions and judgments of others?",
        "agent": "When it comes to turning off negative thoughts and worries about what others think of you, it's important to remember that it's not really about them. It's about your own feelings of shame or fear. You shouldn't let the opinions of others dictate how you feel about yourself. Instead, focus on building your self-confidence and self-worth. Don't worry about the possibility of your picture being up at the post office; that's just an irrational fear. Instead, focus on being true to yourself and living a life that aligns with your values and aspirations."

        "questioner": "No,  it's more like, what did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? That somehow this happened, right?",
        "agent": "How  could I have been more careful? Because after all, everything is your fault, right? Everything's my fault. Therefore, what did I do wrong? Well, everything's my fault, you see, it goes back to a fear, probably, of inadequacy or something. You see, everything's my fault. That's a fear. So when you feel, well, what did I do wrong? And the thing is that it's not blame. When we talk about blame, you see, that's just fear based, too. So the what that you blame yourself? What did I do wrong? Well, the way we should look at it is we should learn from our mistakes. So we might think, well, gee, did I lose a credit card or something? Did I leave my wallet somewhere? Did I do something foolish? Because if I did, it's not that I should feel guilty about it, but I should not do that anymore. If I did something like that, then I need to be aware, so I don't do it anymore. So we don't create this problem, but after that, you accept it the way it is. Okay, I did do something wrong. I left my wallet in the restroom for an hour and then went back, and it was still there. But somebody evidently pulled out a credit card and copied the number down, you say, well, it was a little bit."

        "agent": "You  can realize that, yeah, okay, I didn't do that, right. I need to be more careful. But you also just accept that's life, sometimes those things happen. Sometimes you just walk out and leave your wallet somewhere else. It happens to everybody every once in a while, and most of the time, you get away with it without a problem. But some of the time, it's going to come back and bite you. Well, accept that. You deal with it and go on. You see, you don't take it in at an emotional level of, oh, no, I screwed up. Oh, no, people won't like me. Oh, no. You see, all of this, you look at the negative things, it's all about me, you see? Or it's all about you. The oh, no's are all about you, right? You see? So that's ego, it's all about you. And once you see that ego, immediately you can say, oh, there's a fear here someplace because you don't have the ego without the fear. And then you can start looking for that fear. So, yes, if when something goes wrong, you immediately start looking for your error, the mistake you must have made other wise, it wouldn't have gone wrong. What am I doing wrong? That's a fear. You're not really believing in yourself. You're not saying, well, I am who I am and that's good. I'm not very good and I make a lot of mistakes and when I do, it hurts people. Oh, what was me? That's all ego."

    {
        "questioner": "And  then there's a billion ways that a person could have reacted to that. Somebody would have gotten really angry. We all have these fears, right? Like, there's always something that sort of is like an emotional energy that is attached to things that underlying that is going to be a fear, right?",
        "agent": "And that emotional energy is all part of the COVID up, right? Instead of getting angry and blaming others for the credit card fraud, it's important to address the underlying fear and deal with the problem at hand. Anger and self-blame don't help solve the problem. The reality is that credit card fraud has occurred, and it needs to be dealt with. It may not be enjoyable, but it's a part of life that we all have to face. Not only do you have to deal with it, but the other people involved in the fraud also have to face the consequences. Everyone has to move forward and continue with their lives. It's essential to accept the situation as it is, without personalizing it or making it all about ourselves. When we make everything about us, we place ourselves at the center of the universe. If someone is rude to us, we tend to think it's because they don't like us or have something against us, but in reality, their behavior may have nothing to do with us at all."

        "questioner": "How have you learned to handle situations when someone is rude to you? What mindset shift did you make to avoid taking it personally and getting angry?",
        "agent": "When someone is rude to me, I used to take it personally and get angry. I would think that it was all about me, that they didn't like me or that they were just awful people. But I've come to realize that none of that really matters. The fact is, they were rude to me, and that's a fact I can't change. It's their free will, and they have the choice to be rude if they want to. That's the choice they made, and I can't control that."

        "questioner": "Could  have also been what's that have. It  could have been a perception too. We see certain things based on our story that someone says something and that's, oh my God, that's so rude, and how could they? But it's because it triggers something in us. It triggers our fear, our discomfort, right?",
        "agent": "And let me tell you, all of that is completely unhelpful. Those emotional reactions, they don't do anyone any good. If someone is rude to me, I don't take it personally. I don't make it about myself. Instead, I wonder why they said what they said. Maybe there's something that triggered them or maybe they're just a nasty person who enjoys hurting others. Who knows? But the point is, it's about them, not me. I refuse to be a victim or let their rudeness affect me. It's just a part of life, you know? People can be rude, and we have to deal with it. So how do I deal with it? I don't let fear or ego get in the way. I simply face it head-on. I acknowledge that it happened and move on. And you know what? Most of the time, if I dig deeper into why they said what they said, I realize that it's not really about me. It's about their own misinformation or their own insecurities. Maybe they're having a terrible day. But none of that matters to me. It's just not important. It should be more important to them because they've just shown their own bad behavior that they need to work on. But for me, it's not a bad thing at all. In fact, it's a blessing in disguise as it allows me to focus on what truly matters and prioritize my own growth and happiness."

        "questioner": "When faced with situations that trigger fear or problems in others, how can you ensure that you focus on being productive and finding solutions that make things better, rather than adding fuel to the fire?",
        "agent": "When we encounter situations that trigger fear or problems in others, it's important to remember that it's not necessarily our responsibility to fix them. Unless, of course, it involves someone close to us like our mother or wife. In those cases, we should find the best way to support them and help them overcome their challenges. The key is to focus on being productive and finding solutions that make things better, rather than adding fuel to the fire. For example, if someone is rude to us or our bank account gets hacked, we can choose to learn from the experience and move on, or we can dwell on it and let it make us unhappy. However, dwelling on negative experiences only makes everything worse. It affects our interactions with others and creates a ripple effect of negativity. If we're feeling angry about a credit card issue, for instance, and we snap at people, we only escalate the problems. It's crucial to break this cycle and strive for a more positive and productive approach."

    {
        "questioner": "People  don't want to help you and it can go way out of control because you're in your state. And that I learned. I don't know if I want to say the hard way, but you can. Certainly it's that old saying of it's better to treat with sugar than it is to treat with whatever it is that saying is. But the thing is that so much of what we do is hidden beneath the levels that we don't even sometimes realize what we're doing. It's that real deep desire to want to take the time to figure out the whys. Or it's not even the whys, because if we get our head too involved, which I tend to like to do, I really wanted to figure out where it could have happened, and I figured it out. But that was just like this huge intellectual process that took me most of my evening and night of not sleeping very well and going over and over and over the details. But it's like we get so focused on this intellectual process that we go through trying to figure things out. So much is based on psychotherapy and all of these processes that we tend to fall towards have a high intellectual basis to it. Sometimes it's better just to get into your body and to feel and to feel where there's blocked energy or the emotion or whatever that is that's even underlying the intellectual. But it's like there's this process that we go through and even when we are determined that we want to grow and evolve towards love, we can still get caught up in the process.",
        "agent": "Yeah, we can. You see, that's the intellectual thing. We tend to live our lives out of our heads, right? That's doing the things that we think we should do. And some of that's necessary. It was probably a very good thing that you figured out how it is your credit card number got compromised because now you can make sure that that doesn't happen anymore, you see? So it's good to use your intellect to figure some things out. But we don't want to live our life out of our intellect. We need to live our life right out of our being level doesn't mean that you can't think. You can think, but you have to know the difference between thinking in a way that is productive and thinking in a way that you're telling yourself a story because it's what you want to hear. You see? Absolutely. The intellect isn't the enemy. We need an intellect. We just don't need the intellect to be in the service of fear, you see. And when the intellect is making up stories, then to give us excuses for the way we are, then that's intellect in the service of fear. And when that is part of the problem and most of us living our lives through our intellects, it's probably 80% of the time it's intellect in the service of fear because most of us are really dominated by these fears. So we need to realize that when we say stuff happens and you just have to deal with it, that doesn't always mean deal with it intellectually. Mostly it doesn't mean deal with it intellectually. It means deal with it on a being level. And that means connecting with our inner selves, understanding our emotions, and finding a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in our experiences."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When faced with challenges or difficult situations, what approach should you take that goes beyond intellectual processing and involves a deeper level of acceptance and action?",
        "agent": "Dealing with something doesn't always require intellectual processing. In fact, most of the time, it calls for a deeper level of acceptance and taking action when needed."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "But  learn from identify all of the little things, though I think we spend so much time again analyzing, do we need to know the emotion? Do we need to even know the fear necessarily?",
        "agent": "No.  All that analyzing is another way of sweeping things under the rug. Instead of looking at the problem, we're looking at all the details around the problem, but we're not looking at the problem. Well, I don't have time to look at the problem. I'm too busy trying to figure it out, you see. And then eventually you kind of just wear yourself out on that to where you can now go on and okay, it stays safely under the rug. So often this trying to figure everything out is a waste of your time and it's another strategy for not looking at what you don't want to look at. Yeah, the details often don't matter. There's been some studies that have shown that a good listener is as effective in treating mental emotional problems as is a psychiatrist. And basically to have somebody who will listen and you can talk to is just about as good as far as their effectiveness. It's really close the same. The fact that what the psychiatrists will do is they'll figure out all the details. Oh, you're like this because of that."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "But  they don't usually tell you anyway, so they're just really just listening and writing in a book.",
        "agent": "Yeah,  but they're listening and you get to talk. And that's the therapeutic part, you see. It's not what they say. And if they give you some kind of reason for it, then you no longer have to take personal responsibility for that because you've got a reason."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "I  have neurosis, right? I have an excuse. I have this neurosis that's not going.",
        "agent": "To go away, right? And let's see, my mother gave that to me. It's not really even my responsibility. I got that from my family or whatever. I was bitten by a dog when I was three years old. Yes. So once you can name, you see, intellectually, you can put labels on things, and then we can blame it on the labels of, oh, here's what is wrong so that way we avoid taking personal responsibility for being who we are. So the intellectual part can just be another strategy for slipping out the back on becoming authentic. And, yeah, we spend way too much time trying to figure out details when the details really don't matter. It really doesn't matter what those details are, but we focus on them because that gets us out, that gets us doing something else. It's a distraction. Yeah, but it's a hard thing to do. You made a comment about learning the hard way. I think everybody learns the hard way. I don't know that there's any other way to learn except the hard way. Learning the easy way. Like just listening to our talk, somebody says, okay, I heard that fear is the problem. All right, I'm healed now. You see, that's the easy way, right? You just understand it. I'm just going to let go of all those fears and I feel so much better. You see, obviously that doesn't work very well. That's the easy way. The hard way is that you have to get down and wrestle those fears to the ground. And that's not always an easy thing to do. It takes a lot of courage. But first you have to understand that the problem is not just fear, it's the underlying beliefs and patterns that create fear. So you have to dig deep and confront those beliefs head-on. It's a challenging process, but it's the only way to truly overcome your fears and grow as a person."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When facing a problem, how can you ensure that you are addressing the root cause rather than getting caught up in trivialities and distractions?",
        "agent": "It's never easy to solve a problem. It requires a great deal of courage. However, it's important to recognize that the problem you're currently focused on may not be the actual problem. It could be just a symptom of a deeper issue. To truly address the problem, you need to dig deeper and understand its root cause. This requires more than just intellectualizing; it requires an honest emotional connection. Once you've identified the root cause and accepted it, you can confront it with courage. You'll be surprised to see that many of the other issues you were dealing with will simply disappear. It's like pulling out the roots of a plant - the leaves will wither and vanish on their own. By addressing the root cause, all the other distractions and insignificant issues will naturally fade away. So, the key is to focus on the real problem and not get caught up in the trivialities that keep us busy and divert our attention."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "They  don't feel insignificant.",
        "agent": "No.  They feel like they're the biggest thing going. Yeah, they do. But your best friend said something really nasty to you and that really hurt. And that may be the biggest thing in your life for the next month. Just dealing with that and see, that's the wrong thing. That's not dealing with it, right. That's avoiding it, dealing with it, resolves it, churning it over and over and over and how unfair and whatever. That doesn't resolve it. That just makes it worse."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah.  Never has anything to do with the other person. I mean, it really never the other person. Yet we put so much energy on justification and being right and how dare they?",
        "agent": "And all of that's because I don't deserve that kind of treatment. So it gets back to me, right? And that's the problem. That's my ego. I don't deserve that. That's unfair. And that's kind of the starting place. And after that, I start feeling bad and then I feel angry, and then I feel hurt, and I go through all this other stuff, and all of that is just my ego. And my ego is all tied to fear. So yes, it is a hard problem, and typically I deal with symptoms, and I deal with three or four levels down in my fear. And I don't realize it, but my life's choices, the things I do, the things I feel and think are about 80, 90% driven by my fears. And I don't realize that my life is that driven by my fears. But once I get to it, I find that it is. But once I get to it, once I see it, now I'm in a position to do something about it. You see, as long as I just keep making up stories, then I'm not in a position to ever fix it. I can't fix something I refuse to look at, I can't fix something I refuse to admit exists, right? So I'm just stewing in my own juice. You see, when I am working with these fears and there's no chance that I fix it or change it or that my life will ever be anything more than a struggle because I'm not ever getting to the root cause of what the problem is. And that root cause is not somebody else. That root cause is mine. And it's at the being level. And it's not that I'm doing things wrong, but rather that I need to address my own mindset and beliefs."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What is the key to resolving your issues and finding a solution to your problems?",
        "agent": "The root cause of your issues lies within yourself. It is at the core of your being. It's not that you're making mistakes in your actions, but rather that there is something wrong with your essence. To resolve your problems, you need to address your being, not just your actions."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Okay,  we've worked through something and we've decided or we've worked into the energy and the fear is abandonment. How do we shift that? How do we say when all of our experiences, that story we've done, have shown us that this will be what happens? How do we let go of that fear? How do we face that fear so that it shifts, so that it changes, so that whatever it is that happens with those core deep, hidden fears, what do we do?",
        "agent": "First thing I do when I get there is acknowledge the feeling of abandonment. It's a fear that lingers, even with friends. But I've learned to accept it and face it head-on. I know that I can handle being alone and dealing with false friends. I'll keep moving forward and make new connections. If those friends abandon me too, I'll adapt and find new ones. It takes courage to embrace the reality that abandonment is a possibility, but I won't deny it or play mind games to convince myself otherwise. That only leads to more fear and insecurity. Instead, I accept it as part of my experience. Trusting others for the long term may not be feasible, so I focus on living in the present. I cherish the moments I have with good friends, even if they might turn on me later. I'll face that when it happens and deal with the consequences accordingly."

        "questioner": "How do you approach the fear of abandonment and navigate the possibility of being betrayed by friends? How do you find the courage to accept and face this fear head-on, and what mindset do you adopt to overcome it?",
        "agent": "I spend time with my friends and enjoy their company. Even if they betray me later, I will handle it and find new friends. I believe in accepting fear rather than denying it. By owning our fears, we realize that they won't actually materialize, even though we may feel like they will. Once we accept our fears, we no longer have to be afraid of them. We can deal with them and move forward in life without constantly worrying that something good will be taken away from us. This mindset requires courage because our fears are deeply ingrained. However, it is the only way to truly overcome them. If something bad happens, we can handle it and move on. We can find new friends, new partners, or new opportunities. Life will still be good, and we can appreciate the beauty of each day. The sun will rise, and there will always be wonderful moments to cherish."

        "questioner": "And  choose love, meaning choose to love others regardless of whether they are going to abandon you.",
        "agent": "Just exactly. Love is something I have to give. Love can't be conditional. It just has to be something I give because I want to, because I feel like giving it. And if the other person trashes it or throws it away, I go on, right? I deal with that, and I go on with my life. My life can be happy and successful and fulfilling just the same. You see, I can just let that be, all right, I'm going to love. And sometimes that'll work out, sometimes it won't. Sometimes that'll really be great, and sometimes it'll only be great for a certain period, and then it won't be anymore, and that's okay. I'll have those great periods, and that's good, you see, that's a good thing. Don't start off feeling like, oh, if it doesn't last forever, oh, no, and start worrying about the things that might happen. That ruins everything. I just need to say, well, if it's great for a day, I'll have that day, and it'll be a wonderful day, and I'll always have that wonderful day. And if it falls apart after that, I'll have another wonderful day some other way, some other place, some other time. I'm going on, you see. That's the courage that it takes to own it and just accept it. And by accepting it, I don't mean I'll always be this way. I mean accepting it. And this is the way it is now. I'm moving on. I'm not letting this push me around anymore. I'm going to go out and live a life and have a good time and love and connect and do all those things. And no, there's no certainty that any relationship will last forever, but that doesn't mean I won't enjoy the moments of love and connection that come my way."

However, it's important to acknowledge that there are no guarantees in life. Things may not always work out as planned, and that's alright. I accept the uncertainty because I understand that life is about the process, not just the end result. It's about the continuous act of loving, giving, and caring that allows us to grow and evolve. This is what truly matters. It's not about striving for absolute security or avoiding any potential hardships. Difficulties may arise, and that's okay. When they do, I face them head-on without anger or distress. I simply deal with them and move forward. This mindset is crucial. Instead of being fixated on fears like abandonment, it takes courage to accept and embrace them. So, if abandonment happens, I acknowledge it and keep going, knowing that life still holds countless opportunities for joy and fulfillment. Even during challenging moments, I gather strength and persevere, knowing that more happiness awaits. This attitude applies to any issue we may face. Abandonment is just one example. The key is to confront our fears, understand what drives us, and have the courage to accept them. Only then can we truly live life to the fullest."

        "agent": "You know, it's important to take a step back and really understand what's driving us. What is it that triggers our anger? What makes us feel sad or victimized? What lies at the core of our ego? Once we can identify and accept these things, they lose their power over us. Let's say you have a fear of inadequacy, of never quite measuring up or understanding things fully. Instead of letting that fear control you, why not accept it? Embrace the fact that you may never be perfect in every situation. Instead, focus on being true to yourself. If who you are isn't enough for others, that's their problem, not yours. Live your life authentically, without worrying about the consequences. Be moral, be caring, and do your best. And when things don't work out, don't let it ruin you. Deal with it, learn from it, and move on. By letting go of the baggage and not letting setbacks define you, you're almost guaranteed a happier life."

        "agent": "It's not something that completely ruins you. It's not something that throws you into chaos. It's not worth crying over for days. It's simply about how we perceive other people. Other people are who they are. They can be mean, false, or any number of things. But that's not your concern. It's their problem. You only have to deal with it when necessary and then move on. Don't surround yourself with people who consistently mistreat you. Find new friends, new interests. Just keep going so that your life naturally becomes a positive, happy, and successful journey. If you have that mindset, it's fear that diminishes your happiness and success, keeping you stuck in a negative state. It's not fair, it's so unjust, and you start feeling abandoned and inadequate. And then you're constantly stuck in that negative state. The more you feel that way, the easier it becomes. If you continue to indulge in those negative feelings and habits, it will only attract more negativity into your life. It spreads your negativity to those around you and ultimately creates a dysfunctional life filled with struggle, pain, and misery. And that's what most of us are doing. We're living out our stories without being true to ourselves, constantly facing challenges and feeling unhappy. And it's our own choices that lead us to that state."
