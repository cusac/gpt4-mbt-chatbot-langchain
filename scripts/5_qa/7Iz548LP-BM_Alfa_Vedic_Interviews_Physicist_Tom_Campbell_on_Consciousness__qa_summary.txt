    "On the latest episode of Alpha Casts, Mike Winner and Dr. Bear Paul Lando welcomed Tom Campbell, author of the My Big Toe trilogy, to the show. Campbell's work unifies science and philosophy, physics and metaphysics, and explains most of the remaining big questions in both fields. He combines a fundamental understanding of consciousness and virtual reality to back up his predictions with a logically and scientifically derived My Big Toe theory. \n\nDuring the conversation, Campbell discussed the importance of exploring inner space and gaining a deeper understanding of the world around us. He referenced the image of Buddha sitting under a tree, contemplating the nature of reality and having an AHA moment, as an example of the benefits of taking the time to explore one's own consciousness. \n\nCampbell's unique abilities and experiences provide information that is not found anywhere else. His model of consciousness derives quantum mechanics and relativity, eliminates quantum weirdness, and builds a scientific foundation under much of what was previously deemed paranormal. He shared his insights and experiences with the audience, emphasizing the value of shared information. \n\nOverall, the conversation provided a fascinating look into the intersection of science and philosophy, and the importance of exploring one's own consciousness in gaining a deeper understanding of the world around us.",

When asked how to reinterpret ancient wisdom in terms of the metaphors and vocabulary of our time to bring everyone else along with it, Campbell explained that it's important to restate ancient wisdom in terms that mean things to us. He gave an example of the Bhagavad Gita, which might be difficult for a left-brain science guy to understand without reinterpretation. Campbell also discussed the various paths and practices that people have used to explore their own consciousness, from meditation to psychedelics to lucid dreaming.

He believes that we are just now at the part where progress is starting to accelerate. Campbell emphasized that technology is a key ingredient in making progress possible, as it allows us to connect with each other in ways that were not possible before. He believes that technology can be used to share information, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects that can make a real difference in the world.

Technology can be used to connect with people who share our interests and values, but we must also be willing to step back and reflect on our experiences, and to explore the subjective aspects of our consciousness.\n\nWhen asked about the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Campbell acknowledged that it is a fascinating example of how technology can enhance our understanding of the world around us. It played a crucial role in discovering the Higgs boson, but it's important to remember that technology is only a tool. We must be mindful of its limitations and remember to step back and reflect on the implications of our discoveries. In fact, the scientists at CERN have already realized that they can't think of the electron as a piece of mass with a charge anymore. They think of it as a point with the attributes of mass and charge, which is essentially information. This realization has led many physicists to believe that our reality is information-based. It's an exciting time for science, but we must also be willing to explore the subjective aspects of our consciousness and strike a balance between using technology and stepping back to reflect on our experiences.\n\nIn summary, Campbell believes that technology can enhance our understanding of the world around us, but we must be mindful of its limitations and remember that it is only a tool.

He notes that if we live in a virtual reality, then we can look at virtual reality to understand what it means to live in one. All virtual realities have a few things in common. One thing is that they have to be computed, which means that you need a computer. However, that computer has to be nonphysical from the viewpoint inside the virtual reality. So if you're an elf in a virtual reality, then that computer can't be in elf land. It has to be nonphysical to the elf inside the virtual reality because the virtual reality doesn't compute itself. It has to be computed somewhere else outside the reality. Another point is that all virtual realities have to have players. There has to be a reason for a virtual reality to exist.\n\nCampbell suggests that if we apply this to the concept of living in a virtual reality, it suggests that there must be a nonphysical computer that is computing our reality, and there must be a reason for our reality to exist. This is a fascinating concept, but it's important to remember that it's still just a theory.

By encouraging scientists to share their ideas and perspectives, we can explore new areas of research that may not fit neatly into our current understanding of the world.\n\nCampbell emphasizes that technology is only a tool and that we must be willing to explore the subjective aspects of our consciousness and incorporate both the objective and subjective aspects of experience. This can help us take a more holistic approach to understanding the nature of reality.\n\nRegarding the concept of virtual reality, Campbell finds it an interesting area of research. He notes that if we live in a virtual reality, then we can look at virtual reality to understand what it means to live in one. All virtual realities have a few things in common. One thing is that they have to be computed, which means that you need a computer. However, that computer has to be nonphysical from the viewpoint inside the virtual reality. So if you're an elf in a virtual reality, then that computer can't be in elf land. It has to be nonphysical to the elf inside the virtual reality because the virtual reality doesn't compute itself. It has to be computed somewhere else outside the reality. Another point is that all virtual realities have to have players. There has to be a reason for a virtual reality to exist.\n\nWhen asked about how this concept applies to our own reality and how it suggests the existence of a larger consciousness system, Campbell explains that all virtual realities have to have a reason for existing. They need a purpose, and that purpose is that they have players that play the avatars that are in the virtual reality. By definition, virtual realities make avatars. When we apply this concept to our own reality, we have our bodies, which aren't really us. Our bodies are just the avatar, a computation. We are consciousness, the choice maker. That's what the player does. The player makes choices for its avatar. So, the computer computes, and this computer has to be in the same reality as the player. The player is consciousness making our choices, and that computer is also consciousness. It's in that same reality frame.\n\nCampbell posits a larger consciousness system, which is all of consciousness. It's an information system. This makes sense because what are we? We are information. We are bits of data. We are consciousness. And this larger consciousness system is what gives rise to our reality. It's what gives rise to the physical world that we experience. It's what gives rise to the subjective experiences that we have. And it's what gives rise to the objective experiences that we have.\n\nIn conclusion, Campbell believes that by exploring the concept of virtual reality, we can gain a deeper understanding of the nature of our reality. He suggests that we continue to explore and test this theory to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of our reality. By doing so, we can continue to push the boundaries of our own exploration and gain a more holistic approach to understanding the world around us.",
    "Agent Tom Campbell believes in balancing technology with reflection to gain a holistic understanding of reality. He advocates for a culture of openness and collaboration in the scientific community to explore new areas of research. Campbell finds virtual reality an interesting area of research, as all virtual realities have commonalities such as being computed and having players. He applies this concept to our own reality, suggesting that our bodies are avatars and we are consciousness, with a larger consciousness system giving rise to our reality.

Campbell applies this concept to our own reality, suggesting that our bodies are avatars and we are consciousness, with a larger consciousness system giving rise to our reality. He believes that exploring virtual reality can deepen our understanding of reality. \n\nWhen asked about the concept of mysticism, Campbell agrees that it aligns with his belief in an overriding essence of reality that everything springs from. He also believes that the knowledge gained from quantum physics can be applied practically by understanding that our experiences are unique to us as individuals, but they are also interconnected and influenced by the larger consciousness system. By exploring this concept further and challenging our assumptions and beliefs, we can continue to push the boundaries of our own exploration and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.\n\nCampbell suggests that it's important for people to understand the nature of reality so that it makes sense. Consciousness is the one thing that is real, and everything else is virtual. We are a piece of consciousness, and consciousness is immortal. Avatars die, but consciousness doesn't. Our purpose is to evolve the quality of consciousness, and that's done by lowering the entropy of consciousness. Entropy is a measure of disorder, and the evolution of consciousness is done by taking random bits and turning them into something that is meaningful and significant. \n\nHe believes that big ideas can fly and reach huge audiences very quickly in the 21st century with the Internet connecting us all. Some will call this larger consciousness system \"god,\" while others will call it \"source,\" which is a popular way to mention it these days. With quantum physics, we see that space doesn't matter, and we can instantly have something where we have two of the same particles at the same time in totally different places.

He warns that if the scientific community is not ready for this moment, there may be a power struggle over whose God is a better programmer. Instead, he suggests that scientists need to be ready to challenge their assumptions and beliefs and be more open to new ideas and perspectives.

It's important to remain skeptical of everything and avoid the risks of belief. \n\nWhen asked about how humanity can make a giant step forward in just a matter of decades by evolving our consciousness and shifting away from the warlord mentality of control, power, and force towards a more cooperative and caring approach, Campbell explains that if we all get to the idea that we are consciousness and we are here to care, evolve, love, and ask what we can give, not how much we can take, we can make a huge step forward. He believes that we are coming to a nexus of all these things where we're going to see a great leap forward. \n\nRegarding the use of technology as a tool to facilitate this shift, Campbell suggests that by using technology to enhance our understanding of the world around us and stepping back to reflect on our experiences, we can strike a balance between the two. However, he emphasizes that technology is only a tool, and we need to be mindful of its limitations. We need to use it in a way that supports our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach, rather than relying on it as a solution in and of itself.\n\nCampbell believes that our reality is a virtual reality, with consciousness as the computer and our bodies as the avatar. The rules create consequences, and by creating a virtual reality, consciousness can make life and death choices, survival choices, caring choices, help or hurt choices, and more. This virtual reality is an entropy reduction trainer, and consciousness is playing in it to evolve the quality of its consciousness. Our purpose is to evolve the quality of our consciousness, and we do that by lowering the entropy of our social system through cooperation and caring for others.\n\nCampbell suggests that by understanding the idea that the system needs to evolve its consciousness by lowering its entropy, raising the quality of its consciousness, and becoming love, we can foster a culture of openness and collaboration within the scientific community. He sees technology and the Internet specifically as tools that will help physicists understand that our reality is a virtual reality. Once this understanding is reached, everything will change, and we will be able to use technology to enhance our understanding of the world around us while remaining mindful of its limitations.\n\nCampbell believes that this understanding is totally inclusive and excludes no one. He notes that we can all find a place in this larger consciousness system that gives rise to our reality, including the physical and subjective experiences we have.

    "Tom Campbell believes that consciousness is the only real thing, and everything else is virtual. He argues that our reality is information-based and can be computed, which means that we may be living in a virtual reality. Campbell notes that current Western science is based on materialism, which is a big machine that is deterministic and has no consciousness or choices. However, he emphasizes that consciousness is the one thing that is real, and everything else is virtual. \n\nCampbell suggests that by understanding the concept of virtual reality and the larger consciousness system, we can continue to push the boundaries of our own exploration and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. He emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between using technology to enhance our understanding of the world around us and stepping back to reflect on our experiences. It's important to remain skeptical of everything and avoid the risks of belief. \n\nCampbell believes that love is the ultimate entropy reduction method at the cellular level, and people who harbor any emotions other than love tend to get sick. It's something that we can observe in society at large as well. When there's a lack of love and cooperation, chaos and devolution tend to follow instead of evolution. He defines love as the nature of a low entropy consciousness and sees it as an entropy measurement. Campbell believes that science will eventually be able to measure love, and he sees many people coming to this same conclusion in their own way, on their own path. \n\nRegarding the use of technology as a tool to facilitate a shift towards a more cooperative and caring approach, Campbell suggests that it can be a powerful tool to facilitate this shift. However, it's important to remember that technology is only a tool, and we need to use it in a way that supports our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach, rather than relying on it as a solution in and of itself. \n\nCampbell believes that our reality is a virtual reality, with consciousness as the computer and our bodies as the avatar.

However, he notes that meditation is just one piece of the puzzle. To tap into our intuitive side, we need to learn to let go of our habit of immediately assessing, vetting, and judging anything that comes up. We need to be still, open our minds, and accept what comes to us. This can be a challenging process, especially for those who are left-brained and process-oriented, but with practice and dedication, we can learn to let go of our intellect and be more open to accepting intuitive processes.\n\nCampbell believes that telepathy will become more common as we evolve and interact with each other and the larger consciousness system in a more effective way. He recommends meditation as a key piece of the puzzle to tap into our intuitive side. It's important to have a quiet mind to allow intuition to take over. Interrupting ourselves with constant thoughts and distractions will hinder our intuition.\n\nCampbell sees technology and the internet as tools that can help us understand our reality as a virtual reality, but we need to be mindful of their limitations and potential pitfalls. He believes that a shift towards a more loving and cooperative society could happen faster than expected, but it ultimately depends on individuals making the choice to become more loving and cooperative. Our intention and positive thinking can have a profound effect on the future probability of events, and we can use our mind as a powerful tool to heal ourselves and create positive results in our life.\n\nIn conclusion, Campbell believes that harnessing our intuitive side is key to interacting with the larger consciousness system in a more effective way, and love is the answer and the key to evolving the quality of our consciousness. Each of us has a role to play in our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach, and it's about caring for others and asking what we can give.

Our consciousness is already out of our body, and all we need to do is switch data streams to access other realities. Campbell believes that consciousness is the only real thing and can be computed, and our purpose is to evolve the quality of consciousness by lowering its entropy.

    "Tom Campbell, a teacher of courses in remote viewing, telepathy, and talking to dead people, believes that developing our intuitive side is essential for our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach. He emphasizes that meditation is a great starting point to let go of our intellect and allow intuition to take over. To tap into our intuitive side, we need to learn to let go of our habit of immediately assessing, vetting, and judging anything that comes up. \n\nWhen asked how one can effectively quiet their mind and trust the information that comes to them without the intellect getting in the way, Tom explains that the first step is to let go of our intellect. This means not immediately assessing, vetting, or judging anything that comes up. Instead, we need to be still, open our minds, and accept what comes to us. The next step is to be in that meditation state, open and empty, and then have an intent. Intent is the motive force in consciousness. When you have an intent, let's say, a piece of information, you want to know, maybe you're remote viewing and you want to know what's going on back someplace else. Somebody maybe you know lives on someplace else, and you want to know what's happening with them. You have an intent to get that information.\n\nTom emphasizes that the key is to not let the intellect get in the way of that intent. As soon as the intellect gets in charge of the process, the process is dead. It isn't going to work. So, to overcome this challenge, we need to practice letting go of our intellect and be still, open our minds, and accept what comes to us. We need to be in that meditation state, open and empty, and then have an intent. And we need to trust that the information will come to us without the intellect getting in the way. It's about training our minds to settle down and be quiet, and to be more aware and open to the world around us.\n\nTom also emphasizes that when it comes to accessing other realities and developing our intuitive side, it's important to remember that the first thing that comes to our mind is often the best thing. In consciousness, searching the database is 1000, maybe a million times faster than it is in searching. Google takes about a second to come back with your answers. It's only microseconds before you get the answer back from a consciousness query. So a lot of people aren't even aware that the noise in their mind is just that - noise. They're not empty, so the noise in their mind just blends in with everything else. They push it aside, and as a result, they can't get the information they need. To access other realities and develop our intuitive side, we need to have a clear mind and be open to whatever comes to us. It may come in pictures or other ways, but we need to trust that the information we receive is accurate and reliable. In the beginning, it may be hard to get all the details, but with practice and dedication, we can learn to quiet our minds and be more open to accepting intuitive processes.\n\nTom also believes that telepathy will become more common as we evolve and interact with each other and the larger consciousness system in a more effective way.

To tap into our intuitive side, we need to learn to let go of our habit of immediately assessing, vetting, and judging anything that comes up. \n\nWhen asked about practical tips for remote viewing, Tom suggests starting small and breaking down the information into smaller bites and focusing on attributes like colors, sounds, and emotions. By asking questions like \"What are the dominant colors?\" or \"Does it have an odor?\" one can start to build a picture of what they are trying to remote view. Tom emphasizes that in the beginning, it may be hard to get all the details, but with practice and dedication, one can learn to quiet their mind and be more open to accepting intuitive processes.

He also notes that technology and the internet can help us understand our reality as a virtual reality, but we need to be mindful of their limitations and potential pitfalls. The concept of virtual reality is fascinating when it comes to consciousness and experience. In fact, Tom argues that this physical reality is a multiplayer virtual reality game, while out of Body is mostly a single player virtual reality game. The key point here is that consciousness is the only real thing. Everything else is virtual. In fact, anything that involves experience, anything that's experiential is virtual. Experience requires rules and context in which the experience makes sense and is experienced. It's context-based. The context is offered by the rules. Rules create the context for which experience can happen. Without rules, there's no experience, no interaction, no strategy, no way to relate. It's just nothing. Virtual realities are where all the experiences happen. When you're having an experience in out of Body, you're just in a different virtual reality. So, the rules and context create the framework for experience, and this relates to the idea that consciousness is the only real thing.\n\nFinally, Tom emphasizes that love is the answer to our purpose, and by lowering the entropy of the social system through cooperation and caring for others, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness.

    "Tom Campbell, a teacher of courses in remote viewing, telepathy, and talking to dead people, believes that developing our intuitive side is crucial for our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach.

By paying attention to these experiences and understanding them, we can make more informed choices and continue to evolve the quality of our consciousness.\n\nIn response to a question about multiplayer games in the larger consciousness system, Tom explains that there are different types of realities, including single player and multiplayer games. In a single player game, you are the only conscious entity in that reality, and all the other people, characters, and creatures in there are NPCs. However, in a multiplayer game, there are other conscious entities in that reality, and you can interact with them and share experiences. Tom gives an example of a two player game experience where he went out of body with Dennis Metric and they went on an adventure and saw the same things and interacted with each other. This experience helped him evolve the quality of his consciousness because it allowed him to see things from a different perspective and learn from someone else's experiences. Tom notes that even in a multiplayer game, everyone sees a little different reality based on their own history, beliefs, fears, knowledge, and lack of knowledge. However, there are shared elements in the game that everyone can see and interact with, such as a table in a room. By understanding this and other aspects of the larger consciousness system, we can make more informed choices and continue to evolve the quality of our consciousness.",

These rules ensure that entities outside the virtual reality can only interact in limited ways.

He believes that accessing other realities and developing our intuitive side requires having a clear mind and being open to whatever comes to us. \n\nTom emphasizes that love is the answer to our purpose, and by lowering the entropy of the social system through cooperation and caring for others, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness. He suggests being mindful of our thoughts and actions to ensure that our motivations are aligned with love and cooperation. By focusing on love and cooperation, we can make choices that will evolve the quality of our consciousness and create a better world for ourselves and others. \n\nTom explains that intuition is a tool that can be misused, and the best purpose for using it is to learn, grow, and evolve our consciousness. He believes that there are different types of realities, including single player and multiplayer games. In a single player game, one is the only conscious entity in that reality, and all the other people, characters, and creatures in there are NPCs. However, in a multiplayer game, there are other conscious entities in that reality, and one can interact with them and share experiences. \n\nWhen approaching the nonphysical realm with a sense of love and cooperation, we create positive experiences for ourselves and others. By doing so, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness and create a better world. The larger consciousness system has rules in place to protect consciousness in general from manifesting in negative ways, and entities outside the virtual reality can only interact in limited ways. Therefore, it's important to be mindful of our motivations and make choices that are aligned with love and cooperation. \n\nIn response to a question about the consequences of using one's mind to harm others, Tom explains that there is a price to pay for such actions. The biggest price is that one is deevolving and heading in the wrong direction. Tom emphasizes that focusing on love and cooperation is the key to evolving the quality of our consciousness and creating a better world for ourselves and others. \n\nWhen asked about identifying and dealing with negative entities in the nonphysical realm, Tom explains that it can be a tricky thing. Negative entities can come in different forms, such as other IUOCs who are being negative and trying to use their intent to give us a problem. In these situations, it's important to stay mindful of our thoughts and intentions, and approach the situation with love and cooperation to create positive outcomes. However, negative entities can also be a different kind of thing that is there and is negative and maybe trying to do harm. In these situations, it's important to be aware of these negative entities and approach them with caution and mindfulness. \n\nOverall, Tom believes that developing our intuitive side is crucial for our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach. By practicing remote viewing and tapping into our intuitive side, we can improve our skills and evolve the quality of our consciousness, ultimately leading to a more cooperative and caring approach to life.",

The larger consciousness system has rules in place to protect consciousness in general from manifesting in negative ways, and entities outside the virtual reality can only interact in limited ways. Therefore, it's important to be mindful of our motivations and make choices that are aligned with love and cooperation. \n\nTom emphasizes that focusing on love and cooperation is the key to evolving the quality of our consciousness and creating a better world for ourselves and others. When dealing with negative entities in the nonphysical realm, Tom explains that it can be a tricky thing. Negative entities can come in different forms, such as other IUOCs who are being negative and trying to use their intent to give us a problem. In these situations, it's important to stay mindful of our thoughts and intentions, and approach the situation with love and cooperation to create positive outcomes. \n\nTom also discusses the concept of ARCONs, or individual consciousnesses that may try to manipulate others for various reasons. He notes that these are different from the things that one may see in a data stream from the larger consciousness system, such as what Bob Monroe experienced and wrote about in his book. Tom believes that anything that opens minds is good and can help soften up the human race for the big decision that will need to be made in the future. \n\nWhile psychedelics can be a mind-opening experience, they are not a substitute for personal growth and evolution. Instead, we need to become seekers and learn and grow without relying on drugs. The ones who have done well with psychedelics are the ones who have used them as a wake-up call and then continued their journey of growth and evolution without them. Tom cautions against using drugs as a crutch, as it can lead to deevolution and dysfunction. Those who rely on drugs tend to feel superior to others and associate only with other drug users, leading to a dead-end path. \n\nOverall, Tom believes that developing our intuitive side is crucial for our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach. By practicing mindfulness, setting positive intentions, caring for others, and approaching the nonphysical realm with love and cooperation, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness and create a better world for ourselves and others.",
    "Tom Campbell, a teacher of courses in remote viewing, telepathy, and talking to dead people, believes that having a purpose is important when exploring the nonphysical realm. He suggests that the best purpose is a desire to learn, grow, and evolve the quality of one's consciousness. To tap into our intuitive side, Tom suggests letting go of our intellect and not immediately assessing, vetting, or judging anything that comes up. Instead, we need to be still, open our minds, and accept what comes to us. \n\nTom believes that psychedelics can be a tool to explore the nonphysical realm, but it's important to approach it with caution and mindfulness and not rely on it as a crutch.

While psychedelics can be a mind-opening experience, they are not a substitute for personal growth and evolution. Instead, we need to become seekers and learn and grow without relying on drugs. \n\nWhen asked about the different attitudes towards progress in the non-physical realm and how they can affect the choices being made to help us evolve our consciousness, Tom explains that some entities believe in the Pacifist viewpoint, while others believe in pushing back against harm. It's crucial to discern the difference and ensure that our actions are motivated by what's best for everyone rather than our own beliefs or ego. \n\nTom believes that the forces that are the main body politic of the non-physical world are more in terms of action and proactive growth. Developing our intuitive side is crucial for our evolution towards a more cooperative and caring approach.

    "Tom Campbell, a teacher of courses in remote viewing, telepathy, and talking to dead people, believes that having a purpose is important when exploring the nonphysical realm. He suggests that the best purpose is a desire to learn, grow, and evolve the quality of one's consciousness. To tap into our intuitive side, Tom suggests letting go of our intellect and not immediately assessing, vetting, or judging anything that comes up. Instead, we need to be still, open our minds, and accept what comes to us. \n\nWhile Tom believes that psychedelics can be a tool to explore the nonphysical realm, he cautions that it's important to approach them with caution and mindfulness and not rely on them as a crutch. Experience alone doesn't lead to growth and evolution. It's better to learn how to get there on your own through meditation. \n\nTo improve remote viewing skills, Tom suggests using websites that provide targets with associated pictures and asking questions like \"What does it smell like?\" or \"What does it feel like?\" and writing everything down without trying to make sense of it. He believes that accessing other realities and developing our intuitive side requires having a clear mind and being open to whatever comes to us. \n\nTom emphasizes that love is the answer to our purpose, and by lowering the entropy of the social system through cooperation and caring for others, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness. He suggests being mindful of our thoughts and actions to ensure that our motivations are aligned with love and cooperation. \n\nIntuition is a tool that can be misused, and the best purpose for using it is to learn, grow, and evolve our consciousness.

It's crucial to discern the difference and ensure that our actions are motivated by what's best for everyone rather than our own beliefs or ego. \n\nNegative entities in the non-physical realm often use tactics like control, power, and force to try to dominate and control. They see the trend towards love, cooperation, and a desire to create a better world for everyone, and they are pulling out all the stops to do as much as they can to maintain their control. It's kind of like their last big hurrah, but he firmly believes that they will ultimately fail because that's not where this wave is taking us. \n\nApproaching negative entities with love and cooperation can create positive outcomes and help to shift the balance towards a more holistic and inclusive approach to problem-solving. It's also important to ensure that our actions are motivated by what's best for everyone rather than our own beliefs or ego. \n\nUltimately, by evolving the quality of our consciousness and approaching the non-physical realm with love and cooperation, we can create a better world for ourselves and others.

    "Tom Campbell, a teacher of courses in remote viewing, telepathy, and talking to dead people, emphasizes the importance of having a purpose when exploring the nonphysical realm. He suggests that the best purpose is a desire to learn, grow, and evolve the quality of one's consciousness. To tap into our intuitive side, Tom suggests letting go of our intellect and not immediately assessing, vetting, or judging anything that comes up. Instead, we need to be still, open our minds, and accept what comes to us. \n\nTom believes that psychedelics can be a tool to explore the nonphysical realm, but it's important to approach them with caution and mindfulness and not rely on them as a crutch. Experience alone doesn't lead to growth and evolution. It's better to learn how to get there on your own through meditation. \n\nTo improve remote viewing skills, Tom suggests using websites that provide targets with associated pictures and asking questions like \"What does it smell like?\" or \"What does it feel like?\" and writing everything down without trying to make sense of it. He believes that accessing other realities and developing our intuitive side requires having a clear mind and being open to whatever comes to us. \n\nTom emphasizes that love is the answer to our purpose, and by lowering the entropy of the social system through cooperation and caring for others, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness. He suggests being mindful of our thoughts and actions to ensure that our motivations are aligned with love and cooperation. \n\nIntuition is a tool that can be misused, and the best purpose for using it is to learn, grow, and evolve our consciousness. Tom believes that there are different types of realities, including single player and multiplayer games. When approaching the nonphysical realm with a sense of love and cooperation, we create positive experiences for ourselves and others. By doing so, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness and create a better world. \n\nWhile psychedelics can be a mind-opening experience, they are not a substitute for personal growth and evolution. Instead, we need to become seekers and learn and grow without relying on drugs. \n\nTom explains that it's incredibly important to make choices that minimize entropy for yourself and others in the system, but it's important to keep the long term in mind, not just the short term. If you're making choices with the goal of minimizing entropy, then you're on the right track. And if it turns out that you were wrong, then it's important to learn from your mistakes and do better next time. \n\nIt's crucial to discern the difference between entities that believe in the Pacifist viewpoint and those that believe in pushing back against harm. Tom suggests ensuring that our actions are motivated by what's best for everyone rather than our own beliefs or ego. Violence may be required to defeat evil and lower entropy, but the motive must always be love. \n\nUltimately, by evolving the quality of our consciousness and approaching the non-physical realm with love and cooperation, we can create a better world for ourselves and others. This requires a conscious effort to make good choices and grow without relying on shortcuts like drugs or other quick fixes. Practices like martial arts, meditation, breath work, and yoga can be incredibly helpful in building a holistic mindset and evolving the quality of our consciousness. By tapping into our intuitive side, expanding our reality, and connecting with others on a deeper level, we can create a more loving and cooperative world for everyone. \n\nTom and the questioner agree that it's important to listen to the elders of our culture and learn from their experience. They both enjoyed the conversation and found it valuable, especially with what's going on in the world today. Tom feels that he and the questioner come from similar roots and grew up at a time that was very expansive. They both see good signs of growth and learning in the world, especially in the way people have come together to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This gives them hope for the future and the potential for positive change. \n\nWhen asked about the importance of evolving the quality of our consciousness and pushing for kindness and caring for others as a new way to exert our own free will in the system, Tom explains that the global response to COVID-19 has been a positive sign of people learning and growing. Instead of just accepting the situation and saying \"that's just the way nature is,\" people came together to work towards a common goal. They realized that they could make a difference and took action to slow the spread of the virus. This shows that people are evolving and learning to work together to make positive changes in the world.\n\nTom believes that expanding the quality of our consciousness can be achieved through practices like meditation, martial arts, breath work, and yoga. These practices help us to quiet our minds and tap into our intuitive side, which can lead to caring for others on a deeper level. By expanding our reality and connecting with others in the intuitive space, we can create a better world for ourselves and others. \n\nWhen asked about the possibility of using consciousness to repair physical maladies, Tom agrees that it's possible. He believes that as we evolve our consciousness, we will be able to do things that we currently consider impossible. However, he cautions that it's important to approach these ideas with an open mind and not rely on them as a crutch. Personal growth and evolution are still the most important factors in achieving these goals. \n\nOverall, Tom's message is that by evolving the quality of our consciousness and approaching problems with love and cooperation, we can create a better world for ourselves and others. It's important to keep the long term in mind and make choices that minimize entropy for oneself and others in the system. And if we make mistakes, we need to learn from them and do better next time.

Mental healing is one of the easiest things we can do because our ability to affect things depends on the natural uncertainty of what we're trying to affect. Doctors are often guessing about what's wrong with someone, so there's a lot of uncertainty there, and where there's uncertainty, you can use your intent to modify probability. But it's not just about getting anything you want. You have to quiet your intellect and get to a deeper place within yourself. You have to let go of your logical mind and tap into your intuitive side. It's about getting rid of the noise and focusing on what's truly important. Tom suggests checking out his YouTube channel for more information on this topic, including an Immersive that he did in TMI, which is the Monroe Institute. \n\nTo improve remote viewing skills, Tom suggests using websites that provide targets with associated pictures and asking questions like \"What does it smell like?\" or \"What does it feel like?\" and writing everything down without trying to make sense of it. \n\nTom emphasizes that love is the answer to our purpose, and by lowering the entropy of the social system through cooperation and caring for others, we can evolve the quality of our consciousness.
