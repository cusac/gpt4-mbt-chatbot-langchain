        "questioner": "Good  afternoon, Tom. Thank you for being here again today. You recently did an update on the Schrodinger's cat experiment that is part of your MBT science trilogy. There was a comment about that update that asked, would this invalidate the concept that is in the original Schrodinger's, that experiment?",
        "agent": "Well, no. Let me explain a little bit about the Schrodinger's cat experiment. For one, it's a gedunken experiment, and that's a German term which means thought experiment. It's an experiment that was never done. Nobody would ever do it. Nobody's going to put a lot of cats in boxes with poison and things. That's not an experiment that would ever be done. Erwin Schrodinger was the physicist that came up with this, and Erwin Schrodinger was also the person that came up with the wave equation. That wave equation was interpreted to be such that things exist in a superposition of multiple states until the measurement is made, and then one of those states is picked. That is the way physicists interpreted Schrodinger's wave equation. Schrodinger looked at that and he says, yeah, but that's silly. Listen, if you had a bunch of cats in these pens and he went on to do this thing, he says, you'd have to say that the cat was both dead and alive in a superimposed state of being both dead and alive. And then when the measurement was made, you'd get one of those two states, one answer or the other. So that's the idea. Now, Schrodinger said that kind of tongue in cheek, because it is bizarre to think of a cat being both dead and alive at the same time. And that's what your quantum physics says. That's how it works. Well, it doesn't work like that. Schrodinger wasn't really complaining or not complaining about it. He just was saying, it sure does give a silly result if you think about it in terms of a cat being both dead and alive at the same time. But the truth is, the Schrodinger's cat experiment was never meant to be taken literally. It was meant to highlight the strange and counterintuitive nature of quantum mechanics. It was a way for Schrodinger to challenge the prevailing interpretation of his wave equation. He wanted to show that the idea of superposition, where something can exist in multiple states simultaneously, leads to absurd conclusions when applied to macroscopic objects like cats. So, while the experiment itself may seem absurd, it serves as a valuable thought experiment in understanding the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics."

    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the correct interpretation of Schrodinger's cat experiment and how it relates to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics?",
        "agent": "Well, I was listening to this guy talking about Schrodinger's cat, and he was making a fuss about how it can be both dead and alive at the same time. But let me tell you, that's not how it really works. I decided to do a little experiment in Excel to understand quantum physics better. Turns out, the cat isn't in some weird superposition of states. That's just a misunderstanding that scientists had when they tried to interpret Schrodinger's equations. They looked at the math and thought, 'Hey, all the states are probable, so it must exist in both states simultaneously.' But that's just plain wrong. It's not like that at all. So, in my little Excel experiment, I found out that quantum mechanics works differently. When a measurement is made, the system creating this virtual reality takes a random draw from a probability distribution of all the possibilities. Each possibility has a probability, and you put those probabilities in a distribution. Then, you take a random draw from that distribution. That's how it really works."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain how virtual reality operates when a measurement is made and how the rendering engine generates a result based on that measurement?",
        "agent": "Well, let me explain how it works. In a distribution, you have different possibilities, and then you randomly select one of those possibilities. The more likely something is, the higher its probability, and therefore, it has a greater chance of being selected in the random draw. On the other hand, things that are very unlikely have a very small chance of being chosen. If you find this concept confusing, I recommend checking out my workshops, particularly the one I gave in Huntsville. In that workshop, I go into detail about distributions and how they work. There's even a dedicated 15-minute segment just for explaining the intricacies of this topic. However, I won't delve into that here. The important thing to understand is that this is how virtual reality operates. When a measurement is made, the rendering engine has to generate a result based on that measurement. For example, if you open a door and there's a cat inside, or if you open your refrigerator and look inside, or if you measure the speed of light, the system needs to know what to render. In these situations, there could be multiple possible states, but some states are more probable than others. The system selects one of these states in a random draw, and that's what gets rendered."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the concept of probability distributions and how they relate to the generation of random draws in virtual reality? How does the rendering engine use these random draws to generate a result based on a measurement?",
        "agent": "Well, you see, some possibilities are more likely than others. The system generates a random draw from the probability distribution of these possibilities. Let me explain. I used Excel to demonstrate this concept. I calculated and took random draws from the probability distributions for each passing second or minute. The possibilities remain the same: the cat is either dead or alive, a binary outcome. However, the probabilities of the cat being dead or alive change over time. The longer the radioactive source emits particles, the higher the likelihood that eventually one of them will hit the Geiger counter and kill the cat. So, as time progresses, the probabilities change. When you make a measurement, the result is based on that random draw. That's the essence of Schrodinger's cat thought experiment. It's not an actual experiment, but rather a hypothetical scenario to illustrate a point. Schrodinger used it to highlight the absurdity of the outcome. And indeed, it is quite absurd. What's even more absurd is that some physicists actually accepted it as reality. They claimed that the cat is both dead and alive simultaneously. But, of course, that's simply not true. They analyzed the math, and while the math itself is accurate, their interpretation of it was flawed because it pertains to a virtual reality. Virtual realities only exist in the minds of the participants."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In the context of virtual reality, can you explain how new information is delivered to a player and how it is measured based on a random draw from the probability distribution of possibilities?",
        "agent": "That's not accurate because virtual realities only exist in the minds of the players. When new information needs to be delivered to a player, it is done so at that moment. The player measures that new information, and it is delivered through a random draw from the probability distribution of possibilities. Therefore, cats cannot be both dead and alive. If we didn't have a cat, we could replace it with something like a balloon filled with paint. When the particle hits the Geiger counter, it would pop the balloon and splatter paint inside the cage. The physicists would then say that the cage is both splattered with paint and not splattered with paint at the same time. When we make the measurement, we would observe one of those possibilities. The cat is not relevant to the experiment; it was just included for humor. The experiment I conducted in Excel is correct, although the language I used was not precise. If I had used a ball of paint or a balloon filled with paint, the language would have been perfect because the cat's presence does not affect the outcome of the experiment."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In the context of virtual reality, how does the presence of a cat affect the outcome of the experiment, and what is the significance of the cat's consciousness in the experiment?",
        "agent": "I think of it that way because the cat's relevance to the outcome of the experiment is minimal. The main point is not about the cat itself. However, it was brought to my attention that if the object in the box was indeed a cat and not a ball of paint, then the cat would inevitably perish. When the particle hits the Geiger counter, it releases toxins that lead to the cat's demise. After opening the door, a lifeless cat would be discovered. It doesn't have to die instantly as the door opens. My previous language might have implied that the cat would be in an undefined state until the door was opened, but that only applies to the balloon and the paint, not the cat. The cat is also receiving a continuous data stream, being updated, let's say, 100 times a second. However, the door is not checked at the same frequency. It might be checked once a minute or so. Therefore, the cat could have already died and been dead for some time before the measurement was made and the dead cat was found. Consequently, the body could have been warm or cold, which is a slight difference in language when dealing with an actual cat. Nevertheless, this difference does not alter the Gedanken experiment. It remains exactly the same. Another important point to note here, Donna, is that the cat is conscious. The cat and its consciousness are the first awareness of the cat's impending demise. The last thing the cat hears is the sound of its own heartbeat slowly fading away."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In the context of the experiment, can you describe the sequence of events from the cat's perspective, including the cat's awareness of its impending demise and the role of consciousness in the measurement?",
        "agent": "The very first awareness of the cat dying is when I hear the sound of poison gas leaking into its chamber. I am aware of the fact that I'm getting sick and drowsy, and I know that I'm dying. And then, I die. So it is my consciousness, as the cat, that makes that measurement first. I am the one who is aware of whether I am alive or not, not the human. This fact was overlooked and caused a problem for physicists. They wanted to separate consciousness from the results of quantum physics. They pointed out that the cat would be dead before the experimenter made the measurement. They argued that consciousness wasn't involved because the cat was already dead before the human opened the door to look. The result had already happened. Therefore, the idea that consciousness had to create the measurement was wrong. They thought that only humans are conscious, not cats. But the fact is, I, as the cat, made that measurement first. That's when I realized that I was being poisoned or heard the hissing sound, leading to my heightened state of alertness and survival instincts kicking in."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "From the cat's perspective, what was its awareness when it sensed something was wrong and heard the hissing sound? Can you elaborate on the role of consciousness in the cat's measurement of the poison gas?",
        "agent": "First things first. When I realized that the cat was being poisoned or heard the hiss of the gas, it became aware that something was wrong. The cat may not have been aware that it was dying, but it definitely sensed the change in its environment. This is the consciousness that received the data stream, the measurement of the cat's awareness of the poison gas. It's a mistake to assume that only human consciousness matters or that animals are not conscious beings. If you're interested in this topic, you can visit my YouTube channel and search for related discussions on animal consciousness. Consciousness is consciousness, after all. Now, let's consider a man walking into the woods. When he opens his eyes and looks at the woods, the larger conscious system creates that specific woods for him. If it's a woods he has never seen before, it is created based on probabilities. However, if there's a squirrel living in a tree near the little pond before he reaches the woods, a different woods is already created for the squirrel. The woods experienced by the squirrel may not be the same as the woods experienced by the human, as the squirrel's consciousness operates on its own set of probabilities and perceptions."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does consciousness play a role in the measurement and observation of the double slit experiment, particularly when it comes to the cat's awareness and the collapse of the wave function?",
        "agent": "The squirrel's perception of the woods is different from that of a human. Each consciousness receives a specific data stream based on their perspective, abilities, and experiences. This raises the question of whether a cat observing a double slit experiment would cause the wave function to collapse into a particle pattern. Consciousness plays a role in measurement and observation. However, the cat's lack of knowledge about the experiment means that human consciousness would be the determining factor. The larger consciousness system aims to create a consistent virtual reality that appears real. Inconsistencies, such as the dual nature of light, should not exist. The distribution of photons in an interference pattern when they do not interact with each other is a puzzling phenomenon."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In the context of the double slit experiment, can you explain why single photons end up in an interference pattern and how this pattern ensures consistency between optics and quantum physics?",
        "agent": "When considering why single photons end up in an interference pattern, it's important to understand that they don't interfere with themselves or any other such nonsense you hear physicists say. The reason they end up in an interference pattern is to create consistency between optics and quantum physics. Without this interference pattern, there would be a discontinuity, a logical break. The result in quantum physics had to take place that way to avoid a conflict. A cat, being unaware of the data, wouldn't find a conflict in the data coming out of the double slit experiment. The cat only sees and is aware of things that cats would see and be aware of. Therefore, there is no conflict with a cat. The system doesn't care if a human questions why there is an interference pattern when there is only one particle. It has to do that to be consistent with the wave theory, which involves thousands, hundreds of thousands of particles going through the slits and interfering with each other to create an interference pattern. These particles don't interact just because there are so many of them."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain why the particles involved in quantum physics experiments don't interact with each other and how this leads to results that defy materialism?",
        "agent": "Well, you see, the reason why quantum physics produces results that defy materialism is because the particles involved in the experiments don't interact with each other. It's not like they collide and accidentally create a wave function due to their sheer number. That's just not how it works. The quantum world operates in a way that breaks the principles of materialism. Take the double-slit experiment, for example. Even when the particles pass through the slits one at a time, they still manage to create an interference pattern on the screen. This result is something that materialism cannot explain. Interestingly, the system itself orchestrates this outcome to avoid logical inconsistencies. Surprisingly, the presence of a cat observing the experiment doesn't change anything. The system doesn't perceive it as a problem. However, when humans observe the experiment, that's when things get complicated. Let's say a cat notices the hissing sound of a gas and realizes it's in danger. That moment of awareness is what separates the live cat from the dead cat. It's the cat's measurement of the situation that determines its fate. So, in this case, the cat becomes a dead cat when it hears the hiss, which serves as the measurement indicating its demise. This is how it all works. Whether the inside of the cat cage is splattered with red paint or not, and the fact that it can be both at the same time until the measurement collapses the superposition into a definite state."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you clarify the misconception about superposition and explain how the measurement process in quantum mechanics actually works?",
        "agent": "In regards to the situation with the cat and the red paint, it is important to clarify that the cat is not both splattered with red paint and not splattered with red paint at the same time. This misconception arises from a misunderstanding of quantum mechanics. When a measurement is made, one outcome is chosen based on the probability distribution. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that both possibilities exist simultaneously. I want to emphasize that my answer was correct, as I provided the right explanation for the phenomenon. However, I did make a mistake in stating that the cat is rendered dead or alive when the door is opened and the cat is observed. In reality, the cat may have been rendered dead earlier due to the continuous updates it receives in its environment, while the experimenters only open the door periodically. This discrepancy arises from the difference in update frequency. Despite this minor error, the experiment itself remains valid. The misconception about superposition arises from a misinterpretation of the wave equations in physics. It is crucial to understand that nothing is actually in superposition in this scenario. Therefore, there is no fundamental issue with the experiment, apart from the minor mistake I made."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics and how it relates to the measurement process? Additionally, could you clarify any misconceptions surrounding the idea of superposition?",
        "agent": "Wave equations, that's what it's all about. So, there's nothing fundamentally incorrect there, except for a small detail. You see, the live cat could have actually perished before the door was even opened. It didn't necessarily have to die right at that precise moment."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "That's  very interesting, and I hope that answers the question, does that invalidate the experiment? Because in both cases, no animal was hurt and no balloon exploded. Okay. Thanks, Tom. Schrodinger's cat was not a real experiment, therefore did not scientifically prove anything. Of course, not even part of any scientific theory. Simply a teaching tool that Schrodinger used to illustrate how some people were misinterpreting quantum theory.",
        "agent": "Right.  Misinterpreting, right. Yeah. Except that misinterpreting, they told Schrodinger to sit down and be quiet, that that."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Is  what they're going to say, but they interpret it anyway.",
        "agent": "Yeah,  he was trying to show how silly it was."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Oh,  my God.",
        "agent": "But as a physicist, I fully embraced the concept, accepting it without hesitation. They confidently asserted that a cat exists in a superposition of states, simultaneously dead and alive. Schrodinger, the brilliant mind behind the wave equation and the theory, humorously questioned the fate of cats in boxes. Is the cat truly both dead and alive at the same time? However, his intention was to highlight the flaws in this interpretation. Yet, it is the interpretation that physicists today adhere to, believing that objects can exist in superpositions of states. This, however, is not the accurate interpretation for quantum physics, as Schrodinger himself pointed out. A superposition does not involve multiple states coexisting simultaneously. When there are ten different possibilities, it does not mean there is a superposition of ten different things, with each possibility represented. Instead, when a measurement is made, one possibility materializes into a tangible, physical entity, while the rest vanish. Physicists attempt to transform mathematical equations into something tangible, something real. They interpret the equations in a particular way and assume that it reflects the nature of the world. Initially, when Schrodinger introduced the concept of Schrodinger's cat, scientists acknowledged that it was an incomplete answer and an inadequate interpretation, much like the Copenhagen interpretation. However, no one could propose a more comprehensive alternative. Consequently, as time went on, the Copenhagen interpretation became widely accepted and continues to be the dominant interpretation in quantum mechanics."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What were some of the flaws associated with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, and why did people still consider it the best explanation despite those flaws?",
        "agent": "As the years went by, people increasingly believed that the Copenhagen interpretation was the best explanation available, even though no one could propose a superior alternative. It seemed like they had exhausted all possibilities. However, it's important to note that the Copenhagen interpretation was not without its flaws."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Did  with the devil slip. Why was it so convenient?",
        "agent": "Well,  because if you don't have any other choices, then people don't like being uncertain."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "It's  the uncertainty.",
        "agent": "They  don't like uncertainty."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Okay.",
        "agent": "So they say, well, we don't have any other way to explain it, so it must be that way. Things exist in these superimposed states until the measurement is made and that's the way quantum physics works. However, that explanation is not entirely accurate in terms of what is actually happening in the physical world. The mistake lies in attempting to transform a mathematical equation into a physical phenomenon. When I first started studying physics, I was cautioned about the interpretations of the mathematical equations and their connection to reality. I learned that these interpretations have no bearing on the actual physical world, and it's important not to believe them blindly. Mathematics is a logical process that deals with quantities and provides logical answers. However, when it comes to explaining the physical implications of these equations, things become more complex. While it's relatively straightforward to understand the physical implications of simple equations, once the equations become probabilistic, the connection with the physical world becomes tenuous. At that point, we are no longer discussing a physical process. Instead, we are left with incomplete explanations that rely on statistical interpretations and mathematical models."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the limitations of interpreting mathematical equations in terms of their connection to the physical world and how these interpretations can be mistaken for truth?",
        "agent": "In connection with the physical world, I am not referring to a physical process anymore. I am referring to something else entirely. And it's not just statistical; there are other factors at play. Even if the equations are not statistical, when they become complex enough to describe what is happening physically, physicists use simplified terms to make the subject easier to discuss. However, they are aware that these terms are not entirely accurate. They are simply convenient labels that approximate the reality. Unfortunately, as time passes, these approximations can be mistaken for truth, and they become ingrained in the minds of physicists as the way the world truly operates. This mistaken belief then becomes accepted as a physical reality. Since no one has presented an alternative explanation or a different way of thinking about it, these assumptions persist and are eventually treated as facts. The best interpretation of what these equations actually mean is merely a guess."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah.  Like so many things bubble up to become facts that aren't facts.",
        "agent": "Exactly.  Physics does exactly the same things. It's like we talk about the particles. An electron a very important little particle. That's how all of our electrical stuff works. Electrons. But electrons don't really exist. It's as if there were an electron. People don't measure electrons. I mean, there's the milk and oil drop experiment where they decided what the charge was on an electron. But they measure events. They measure things that happen, and then they make up a story about the theory of why it should happen that way. They were measuring forces. And the problem is that as our science got more and more complicated, the mathematics got more and more complicated to describe it. And pretty soon, we were confusing our mathematics with the real world. Yeah, that's the problem. We're looking at our equations and saying, well, all right, now, how can we interpret that in the real world?"
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Yeah.",
        "agent": "And  we make this interpretation like Einstein's general relativity. Oh, space is flexible. It's like the rubber sheet, and the mass gets there. It's like a big dimple in the sheet. And so they make this. But that is just something they make up because it seems like the best way to describe what the equations are doing. Doesn't mean that it's physical."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Right.",
        "agent": "It  doesn't mean that that's actually what's going on. It's just something we make up to tell that story, because it seems sort of like this. But then you believe it. And once you believe it, then sure enough, there's this big rubber sheet out there. There's this stretchy space time, and it has all these things. And that's just the mathematics. And that's why scientists come up with this silliness about there is no time, because they look at their equations and then they come up, they interpret them to what does it mean physically? And whenever you take a bunch of equations and say, what does that mean physically? You'd have to take that with a grain of salt. Math is not physical math. It's the logic quantity. It doesn't mean that whatever math says that there has to be a physical exact physical correlation to that, that's not true. Physical is something different. Physical stuff doesn't necessarily occur in all possible logic paths. Every possible logic path of quantity doesn't necessarily turn into something physical."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "You  see, what is the thing I'm thinking of then?",
        "agent": "That's the first constant, Newton's idea of gravity. Newton's idea of gravity is represented by the equation GMM over R squared, where G is the gravitational constant. In this equation, you multiply the two masses and divide by the square of the distance between their centers to calculate the gravitational force between them. Newton's idea was that masses attract each other. Scientists observed that when there are two masses, they attract each other. This observation led to the belief that masses attract. The equation represents this attraction as the product of the two masses divided by the square of the distance between their centers, multiplied by a proportionality coefficient, which is a constant. This constant is determined through measurements conducted in a laboratory. So, the idea is that masses attract, and this equation provides a good description of what is happening. However, it's important to note that this description is based on the equation and not necessarily a physical fact. It's a useful way to interpret the equation, but it doesn't have to be the only explanation. The equation suggests that masses are attracting, but there could be other factors at play that make it appear that way."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What are some alternative explanations or perspectives to the idea that masses attract each other, considering that the equation for gravity is just a mathematical representation and not necessarily a physical fact?",
        "agent": "But it doesn't have to be that way. That's just the math. Something is causing it to appear as if the masses were attracting each other. You see, in this case, it's a virtual reality and it's being computed as if those masses attracted each other. So we must not confuse the mathematics with the reality, with the computation of the virtual reality. Yes, it's part of the computation. If you have two masses, then it simply calculates the force between them based on an equation. However, when we observe it, we want to interpret it as something physical. We don't say, well, that's the equation and the virtual reality just calculates that and that's the force it renders. No, we say, oh, the masses attract each other. And then Einstein encountered difficulties with that. He could only push that idea so far. Once he delved into relativity, that explanation didn't work as well anymore. So he introduced the concept of a rubber sheet, where spacetime is stretchy. When you have masses, spacetime stretches around them in a way that gravity particles get caught in that vortex as they pass by. And in regions with large masses, time moves slower. He developed all these ideas to align with his special relativity and proposed a completely different perspective. However, it is important to note that reality is not actually like a rubber sheet. Spacetime is not literally deforming around masses. People tend to interpret it that way, but it is just a mathematical representation that helps us understand the effects of gravity and the curvature of spacetime."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the concept of spacetime and how it relates to the idea of masses attracting each other? How does the analogy of a rubber sheet help us understand this concept?",
        "agent": "In my understanding, spacetime can be likened to a rubber sheet that deforms around masses. This analogy helps us visualize the concept, but it's important to note that it is not a physical representation. Rather, it is a way for us to communicate and discuss the phenomenon. The idea of masses attracting each other is a useful approximation, but it's not an accurate depiction of what is truly happening. We must remember that the physical analogies we use are just interpretations created by physicists to describe the world we perceive. However, it's crucial to recognize that our reality is virtual and computed, meaning that physicality is not a necessary component."

    {
        "questioner": "A  representation of it.",
        "agent": "Yeah,  representation of it. All you need are the equations and a computer and then that's the way it works. And digital computing is not the same as what they call analytic equations. Those are equations that are continuous. You have continuous equations. And that's what we think reality is made of because we have a continuous reality. We think, though scientists are wrong on both, we do not have a continuous reality. We have a pixelated reality, but they think it's continuous. And therefore you need continuous functions to describe it can't have mathematical equations describing reality. If they have holes in them, they have to have continuous functions. So that's called analytical math. And what you can do with analytical math is that you can come close to what actually happens in the world, but it's very, very hard to become exact because the real world is a lot more complicated, like a trajectory. If you fire a cannon, cannonball goes up and it comes down. And it does that basically on a parabola, goes up and down. So it's like y equals x square or x equals y square, depending on where you want your parabola to face. And that's the motion. But then you have air friction. Now it's not a parallel anymore. Now you have inconsistencies in gravitation."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "You  did that.",
        "agent": "Yeah, gravitation isn't a uniform field. There are variations in gravitation due to the Earth not being a perfect sphere and its core not being homogeneous. For instance, there are areas with high density, like mountains made of granite, and areas with lower density, like bodies of water. So, the density is not uniform throughout the spherical Earth. However, we make assumptions and simplify these factors. We neglect air friction, variations in gravity, and the non-spherical shape of the Earth. By doing so, we can analyze the motion of a cannonball and approximate its trajectory as a parabola. This analytical approach provides a mathematical representation that gives us a rough idea of what happens in the real world. But it's important to note that the real world cannot be accurately described solely by analytical equations. In reality, we rely on computational models to simulate and understand complex phenomena. Computational results can capture the intricacies of the real world that analytical math often overlooks. Physicists and mathematicians acknowledge that if we were to consider all the minute details, the analytical functions would become incredibly complex. However, these complex functions would provide the truest representation of reality. In contrast, a digital computer can approximate the real world using discrete calculations. It's interesting to note that some physicists and mathematicians view continuous math as the ideal fit for a continuous reality, while a computer is seen as limited. However, the reality is quite the opposite."

    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the misconception that some people have about continuous math and its relationship to reality, and why it is not the computer that falls short of accuracy?",
        "agent": "I believe that some people have a misconception about continuous math and its relationship to reality. They assume that continuous math must perfectly align with a continuous reality. However, this is not the case. Computers, being pixelated and inherently discrete, can only provide estimations of reality. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the computer that falls short of accuracy, but rather the complexity of reality itself. In fact, reality is computed and can be accurately represented through the use of discrete computations."

That's why you can have all these little annoying things like air friction, and a computer doesn't care, because a computer can just compute all those things as it goes. If you tried to do that, take all those things into consideration, your equations would get very unwieldy and very hard to work with and too big and too immense if you took all of that into consideration. So they just have it backwards. It's the way it is. It's the digital is the way it really is. That's the real thing. And trying to force analytic equations to describe it is painful. It's like trying to put a foot that's too big into a shoe that's too small. It just doesn't work."
