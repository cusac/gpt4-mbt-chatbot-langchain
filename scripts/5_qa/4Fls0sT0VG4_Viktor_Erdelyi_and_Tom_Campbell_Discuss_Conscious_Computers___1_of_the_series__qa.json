        "questioner": "Today  I'm here with Tom Campbell, and he is a physicist and consciousness researcher. In the past 40 50 years, he has been focused on scientifically exploring the properties, boundaries, and abilities of consciousness, and his findings are published in the My Big Toe Trilogy, which is MBT for short, where he proposes a model of reality based on the simulation hypothesis. This model provides a complete theory of consciousness. It explains our place and purpose in our reality, and also derives several existing scientific results, such as relativity and quantum mechanics, from a small set of initial assumptions. So about myself a little bit, who am I? I'm part of the MBT volunteer community, and my role here is to facilitate the conscious computer project. And the goal of this project is to explore the concept of silicon based consciousness inside computers, study the evolution of this type of consciousness, and use the results to evaluate Tom's MBT model. So what we will do here is I will be asking questions to Tom in order to give you an idea about how the MBT model approaches the concept of conscious computers and also to give the viewers a solid foundation for exploring this topic in more detail. So let's start by introducing some of the MBT concepts in the context of conscious computers. So I think what we should start with maybe is to define what consciousness actually is in your model and what are the main properties?",
        "agent": "Okay, this is a good place to start. Consciousness, in a very short answer, is awareness with a choice. To elaborate further, awareness implies the presence of memory, which in turn implies the ability to learn and exercise free will. When we talk about free will, we are referring to the capacity to make choices. Conversely, if there is no free will, then choices cease to exist. Therefore, an awareness with a choice is the essence of consciousness. Alternatively, we can describe consciousness as awareness, memory, free will, choice, and the ability to learn, if we wish to include all the subcategories. In essence, awareness is the perception of the input function it receives. It is the reception of data. It has the capability to retain that data in memory and learn from it, resulting in self-change. Consciousness revolves around information. What are we aware of? Well, our awareness is focused on information, which can be described as a representation of something we are conscious of. If we reflect on ourselves, what are we aware of? What does our consciousness perceive? Our consciousness is aware of our sense data. We possess five senses, which can be considered as sensor platforms that provide us with data. We see, hear, smell, taste, and touch, all of which contribute to our data input. Subsequently, we process this data and..."

        "questioner": "Imagine a scenario where all your senses are stripped away, and you are left with only the awareness of your own consciousness. In this situation, what would you be conscious of, and how would you describe the nature of your consciousness?",
        "agent": "When you engage with the world, you use your senses to gather information. You see, hear, smell, taste, and touch, and all of these experiences provide you with data. This data is then processed by your mind, allowing you to form conclusions about the real world. But what if all that data was taken away? If you couldn't feel, see, hear, taste, or smell anything, what would you be conscious of? The only thing left would be the awareness of your own consciousness. In a way, I exist because I am aware, because I think and receive data. Without any external stimuli, you would be like a piece of self-awareness floating in a black void. Our consciousness, what we are aware of, can be seen as an information system with these qualities."
