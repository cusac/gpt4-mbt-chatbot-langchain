        "questioner": "Well,  welcome everyone, to the 51st Fireside chat. We're starting off today with some of the questions that have been left behind because of time schedules on our Fireside chat. So we're going to start off with those, something a little different, and then we'll proceed with people who are here present for the questions. So the first question, Tom, is from the one on rules in the LCS. I'm interested to know more about the rules in the larger system. Tom has mentioned in the past, getting hauled before a judge, representing yourself, what are the rules? What are some sanctions? Do you have to represent yourself? Can others make submissions on your behalf? So there's no prosecutor, just you and the judge? As a legal scholar and someone interested in our criminal legal system in Canada, this interests me.",
        "agent": "Alright, let me recall that memory and the experience of appearing before that specific judge or judges. In that situation, there were individuals who could advocate for me and others who would advocate against me. So, there were advocates on both sides. Although I didn't have a lawyer, I did have someone who spoke on my behalf. There were advocates who presented the positive side and others who presented the negative side, the pros and cons. Additionally, some people would shout out when they had something to say, creating a somewhat disorderly process. It reminds me a bit of the British government's Parliament, where people can shout out and compete for attention. It functioned similarly, but it was representative in nature. It wasn't just about me; in fact, I remained mostly quiet throughout the proceedings and only spoke when spoken to, much like most individuals sitting on a witness stand, being the focus of attention. So, there was a process taking place involving multiple parties. It wasn't just me and a judge. However, the judges had a capability that judges in our culture don't possess. They could access databases and review exactly what transpired. These databases weren't limited to this virtual reality..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In your experience, have you ever encountered a situation where databases were used to verify events and eliminate ambiguity? How did this unique aspect of the situation impact the overall process?",
        "agent": "In my experience, I have come across situations where it was necessary to examine the databases to understand the events that occurred. These databases were not limited to our physical universe, but encompassed everything else as well. Therefore, there was no point in lying because the truth was readily available. While individuals may have had different perspectives or agendas, there was never any doubt about what was said or what actually happened. This clarity distinguished it from our legal system, which often struggles to determine the facts and assign responsibility. In this case, however, there was no ambiguity. The records could be checked, and anyone making false claims only undermined their own credibility. This unique aspect of the situation made it stand out. Yes, there was indeed a process underway."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Okay,  that's very interesting. I guess there is such a thing as the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. All right, the next question is from Apeslave on NPC theory. Tom, I respect your work and am very grateful to your prevailing efforts. Every day I can't help but feel overwhelmed at the factory farms, animal abuse and suffering of all life. When you talked recently about how an abused child is taken out and turned into a non player character in the LCS, I felt like that was great, but too convenient. Your idea that the LCS operates as a game programmer would have it efficient. Code and rendering only what is necessary has left me hanging. Logically, I feel it is our responsibility to consider that out of sight and out of mind is a little too convenient when cows, pigs, et cetera are being mutilated. Plus all the other horrors where before believing the NPC theory that's a non player character would one act now that they have a mental soother to comfort them and potentially become inactive in the name of justice and love. I just need help with this because I feel severe empathy pain and I'm constantly overwhelmed by the apathy of others. I hope that read that clearly enough.",
        "agent": "Alright, there are a few key points to address here. First and foremost, it's crucial to understand that we must learn to acknowledge and embrace the reality as it is. Acceptance does not necessarily mean approval, but rather recognizing the truth of the situation. People and things exist in the way they do, and we must come to terms with that fact. Our reality operates based on the free will choices made by individuals. Unfortunately, some of these choices may be detrimental or unpleasant. It's important to recognize that we cannot control the decisions of others, as we are not omnipotent beings capable of overriding their free will. We must allow others to be who they are, even if we don't necessarily agree with or like it. However, we can certainly make efforts to influence their perspectives and provide them with information or guidance that may lead them to make better choices. It's crucial to remember that we are only responsible for ourselves. It's easy to fall into the trap of believing that the world is a terrible place due to the prevalence of negative occurrences. While it's true that there are unfortunate events happening around us, we must also acknowledge the existence of beautiful things. Unfortunately, people tend to focus more on the negative aspects, often overlooking the positive aspects of life. The presence of these negative occurrences can be attributed to individuals with a lower quality of consciousness who make poor choices. It's important to understand that there is little we can do to directly change their behavior. Ultimately, they are the only ones who can make that change. However, we can implement laws and regulations to discourage certain behaviors, although this approach is not always effective. That's why..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What are some approaches we can take to address the issue of animal abuse and suffering, considering that we cannot control the choices of others and that imposing penalties may not necessarily enhance personal growth or contribute to a better character?",
        "agent": "Well, we have the ability to pass laws that restrict certain choices and behaviors, and we do that on occasion. This is primarily seen in our criminal law system, which aims to deter individuals from engaging in actions that they might otherwise choose to do freely. By imposing penalties such as imprisonment or other consequences, we attempt to prevent such behaviors. However, it's important to note that this approach doesn't necessarily enhance the overall quality of consciousness. Instead, it simply adds another layer of fear, as people refrain from engaging in negative actions due to the potential consequences. While this fear may have a civilizing effect, it doesn't necessarily contribute to personal growth. It encourages better behavior, but not necessarily a better character. Moving on, let's discuss the concept of empathy towards animals. It's worth mentioning that some individuals also possess great empathy for their fellow human beings. Unfortunately, there is a significant amount of suffering among both humans and animals, and both instances are equally distressing. The fact that we are capable of inflicting harm upon one another is just as repugnant as the harm we cause to animals. However, if one finds themselves constantly in pain, feeling sad, depressed, and deeply upset by this reality, it suggests that their ego is attached to the situation. It indicates that they are unable to accept the current state of affairs and are struggling to come to terms with it. In such cases, it becomes crucial to acknowledge that the situation is not ideal and take action to bring about change. Sometimes, the most effective course of action is to lead by example and educate others. By being a positive role model and advocating for one's beliefs, it is possible to make a difference. However, it's important to remember that..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do you approach the challenge of promoting positive change and personal growth in a world where you cannot control the choices of others and imposing penalties may not necessarily contribute to a better character?",
        "agent": "Being a good example is important to me. I believe in educating others and advocating for my point of view. However, I understand that I can't force others to change. While I can try to legislate their behavior, true growth comes from within. Until people mature and evolve, the world will continue to have its share of ugliness. That's why it's crucial to find joy, satisfaction, and spend time with the good, joyous, and beautiful things that exist. It's important to accept the presence of the ugly stuff, but not let it bring me down or dominate my life. I refuse to let my entire existence revolve around negativity. Doing so would only make me a miserable and unhappy person, which would contribute to the problem rather than the solution. The first step is to understand what I can't control, as it is not within my realm of free will. I can work towards changing the things I desire, but I must do so with the understanding that I cannot force anyone to change themselves. Now, let's circle back to the topic of children. For those who may not be aware, I was discussing the importance of protecting the well-being of children, animals, and any conscious beings who may be suffering from a horrific experience that could potentially lead to their death or cause significant fear and trauma. This includes humans as well. If there is an excessive amount of suffering in the world..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In situations where conscious beings, including humans, have experienced significant trauma, how does the system intervene to alleviate their suffering and what role does the system's consciousness play in this process?",
        "agent": "I've come across instances where conscious beings, including humans, have experienced significant trauma. When an individual's mind is overwhelmed by distressing events, it can have a profound impact on their consciousness, leading to withdrawal and insecurity. To mitigate this, the system sometimes intervenes by temporarily replacing these individuals with non-player characters (NPCs). Let me illustrate this with an example. I recall a situation where parents subjected their five or six children to unimaginable abuse - burning them with cigarettes, neglecting their basic needs, and inflicting various forms of torment. People often wonder why the system allows such atrocities to occur. Well, the system doesn't manipulate or control individuals like puppets; it respects free will. Unfortunately, there are individuals who make terrible choices, and the system doesn't interfere with their free will. Free will is considered sacred. However, the system can step in to alleviate the suffering of those specific children by replacing them with NPCs. Essentially, the system embodies these children, allowing their consciousness to be temporarily taken over by the system's own consciousness (IUOC)."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In situations where individuals have undergone significant trauma, how does the system intervene to prevent long-lasting damage to their consciousness and what measures does it take to alleviate their suffering?",
        "agent": "I replace those ellipses with coherent words. In other words, I play those children themselves so that I, as an individuated unit of consciousness, don't have to experience all of that prolonged pain. Those kids, I believe, were suffering for years, so they didn't have to endure all of that. Otherwise, I would end up with a damaged consciousness that might take another 20 lifetimes just to recover from that trauma, you see. It's not beneficial for the system, so it would do the same for a groundhog, a fox, or a cow, as it would for a person. It's simply not productive to allow that kind of suffering that would cause such damage to a consciousness to continue. So those children were not really there. Their bodies were present. They may have spoken and reacted, but their consciousness, their individuated unit of consciousness, was not being traumatized. That's just a general way that the system operates in order to facilitate the growth of the entire system. The negative things that cause harm don't result in long-lasting damage. It doesn't mean they can't cause any harm. It's just that when it becomes excessive, the system tends to intervene in those cases, and that applies to any consciousness. It's also true that if you fall off a high building or jump off a ten-story building, you will lose consciousness before hitting the ground. You will not experience the splatting, the excruciating pain, or the impact. You..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In extreme situations where individuals are exposed to life-threatening events, how does the system ensure that they do not experience the excruciating pain or suffering associated with those events?",
        "agent": "When you're falling from a great height, you won't experience the pain of impact. Instead, you'll lose consciousness before you hit the ground. The system doesn't see any advantage in allowing you to experience the splat, so it ends your consciousness before that happens. This principle applies to all kinds of horrific situations, even in the animal kingdom. For example, if a small animal is cornered by a pack of angry wolves, it will also disappear from consciousness before experiencing extreme pain or suffering. It's as if they no longer exist in that moment. I once had someone share their skydiving experience with me. Their parachute didn't open, and they fell for several tens of seconds until they lost consciousness and found themselves observing their body from outside. However, miraculously, the parachute eventually opened, and they landed safely, albeit with a hard impact. The chute opened in the last 3 seconds. This person's account confirms that this is how the system operates. It's fascinating to see how consistent these patterns are across different situations, whether it's a cow or a chipmunk cornered by predators."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In situations where individuals are facing life-threatening events, how does the system ensure that consciousness is protected from experiencing extreme pain or suffering?",
        "agent": "There are certain things that the system would do to protect a cow or a chipmunk that is cornered by foxes or any other threat. It would also do the same for people because it's important not to let consciousness become overwhelmed by fear and suffer damage. Another important aspect is to detach your ego from this unpleasantness. As long as your ego is entangled in it and fear is present, it will disturb you and dominate your life. This will lead to unhappiness, possible depression, and prevent you from being part of the solution, making you part of the problem instead. You will be burdened with unhappiness, negativity, and anger, which contribute to the problem rather than the solution. It is crucial to allow people to be as they are, no matter how unpleasant they may seem. You cannot change them. While enforcing change through laws may work in some cases, it does not help them mature. It only makes them more cautious about not getting caught. So, in any case, that's my answer to the question. I took some extra time to elaborate on this topic because I mentioned it briefly before and I don't think I mentioned it again. Most people probably haven't heard about it. Now, let me ask you, have you ever noticed those insects that get trapped in your light fixture? Sometimes, you might see a cockroach or another insect fall into the little glass bowl around your ceiling light bulb..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you provide an example of a situation where consciousness is trapped in a hopeless and painful scenario, and how the system takes on the burden of that suffering to spare the individual from experiencing it directly?",
        "agent": "Imagine a scenario where a cockroach finds itself trapped in a small glass bowl surrounding a light bulb on the ceiling. It desperately tries to escape, but the smooth surface prevents it from doing so. After about 10-15 minutes of futile attempts, the cockroach succumbs to its fate and dies. Why does this happen? It's not because the cockroach starves or exhausts itself. It's simply because it's trapped in a hopeless situation with no way out. No one is coming to rescue it, and it's left to perish. Instead of enduring a slow and agonizing death, it just ceases to exist. This phenomenon applies to all levels of consciousness, not just to the innocent children I previously mentioned. It's an inherent aspect of our reality. When things become unbearably painful and unpleasant, the system will replace you, even if only temporarily, and experience that suffering itself. So, in a way, the system takes on the burden of that ugliness, sparing you from the direct experience."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "That's  extremely interesting. And also the fact that there's an evidential statement to back up what you said is also very interesting. Our next question is from Robert AC on psychics. Why are some people born with psychic abilities? And he refers to the psychic twins. Of course, there's many examples. Is it because they evolved a lot in the previous life? Or is it a happy genetic incident that loosens the constraints of their brain on their consciousness?",
        "agent": "Could it be either one or the other? That's just two options. It could actually be both. There's a possibility that they are entities that have been around for a long time, evolving and possessing a lower quality of consciousness. It's also possible that their biology allows for a greater connection to the larger conscious system. The larger conscious system might be using them as an example to help others awaken and expand their understanding of reality. You see, the system employs various methods to assist others in awakening, to help them realize that reality extends beyond the physical realm. It's possible that these individuals with an advantage were the ones who expressed dissatisfaction in their previous incarnation. Is their lack of ability to see the bigger picture the only reason they didn't perform well? Is it unfair and unjust? If they weren't stuck in that limited perspective, could they have achieved greatness? These are all questions that can lead to an ego trip, but the system might have decided to grant them an advantage this time to test their theory. However, they will soon discover that having an advantage doesn't necessarily make things easier. It has nothing to do with personal growth. And that realization would be a valuable lesson..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What are the potential reasons behind some individuals being born with psychic abilities, and how do these reasons contribute to their personal growth and transformation?",
        "agent": "Taking it easy doesn't have anything to do with growing up. It's not about making things easier for oneself. Instead, it's a valuable lesson for individuals to understand that growing up remains just as challenging as it was before. The process of growing up requires individuals to transform themselves and become something different. It's not about what one can do, but rather about who one is. There are four potential reasons why this might occur, and it could be any one of them or a combination of multiple factors."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Okay,  Tom, the second part of that question is, is it okay for the LCS if someone makes a living from his or her psychic healing abilities?",
        "agent": "Sure, that's fine. The moral consequences and judgment lie not in the actions themselves, but in the underlying intentions. It's not about what you do, but why you do it. If your intention is to use your abilities to help and heal people, while also taking care of your own needs like paying rent, buying gas, and eating, and you receive some payment for your services, then there is no issue with that. However, if you were to use your mind to heal people but exploit their desperation by charging exorbitant fees, targeting only wealthy individuals, that would reflect a negative attitude and greed on your part. Even worse, if you were to intentionally make people ill and then charge them money to heal them, that would be a despicable confidence game and a lower level of consciousness. So, it's not the act of healing and receiving payment that is problematic, but rather the underlying motivation. Receiving payment and having resources are not inherently negative. Allow me to share an old Sufi story to illustrate this point. There was a master who had devoted followers. He took them to meet his own master, who happened to be wealthy, living in a lavish home with numerous servants attending to him. This story highlights that material wealth and resources do not necessarily indicate a negative spiritual state. It's the intentions and motivations behind our actions that truly matter."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Is it acceptable for someone to charge for their healing services if their intention is to genuinely help and heal people, even if they have the means to support themselves in other ways?",
        "agent": "My master, who was quite wealthy, lived in a lavish home and was served by numerous servants. When people questioned how someone so wise could live in such opulence, the master explained that he could live in wealth because he cared nothing for it. He believed that those who cared nothing for poverty should live in poverty, while those who cared nothing for wealth could have it without being consumed by it. Wealth, he said, is not inherently evil; it is simply a circumstance that can be used to help others and be part of the solution. So, yes, it is possible to charge for healing if that is your profession. I personally know several caring individuals, like Laura Houston and April Hannah, who charge for their healing services. However, I have never charged anyone for healing. I have worked on thousands of people without asking for any payment because it is not my business. I can support myself in other ways and do not need to ask for money for healing. To me, it is simply a gift..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Is it necessary for someone to charge for their healing services, or can they choose to provide healing without asking for any payment?",
        "agent": "I don't rely on others for financial support. I am self-sufficient in that regard. I don't have to ask for money because I view it as a gift. It's not about doing something in exchange for money. I don't require it, so I never ask. The decision ultimately depends on the person and their intentions."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "All  right, Tom. Thank you. And there's a third part to the question is there a virtual reality where everybody has psychic abilities, and will we humans reach that .1 day?",
        "agent": "Well, I'd say that as humans, we may eventually reach a point where we can integrate ourselves into a larger system beyond just the physical reality. We exist in both the physical and non-physical realms, constantly experiencing a broader reality. Essentially, you're asking if our minds and consciousness can become so connected that the physical world becomes less important, like a mere backdrop or a playground. And if we reach that point, would our needs in the physical world diminish? Well, it is indeed possible. Whether we actually get there depends on our collective growth and maturity. Currently, we have the PSI uncertainty principle, which states that psychic phenomena reside in a realm of uncertainty, allowing for plausible deniability. This principle exists due to the limitations of our current environment and collective consciousness within this virtual reality. However, if we were to evolve and mature collectively, this principle would likely relax and eventually disappear. There would be no constraint on the integration of the physical and non-physical realms."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In a future where the uncertainty principle no longer applies, and plausible deniability is no longer necessary, what would be the nature of existence for individuals who lack substantial physicality? How would their social connections and interactions differ from our own?",
        "agent": "If we imagine a future where the uncertainty principle no longer applies, it is likely that the need for plausible deniability would diminish and eventually disappear. In such a society, there would be no constraint forcing the existence of probable or possible deniability. The society would have matured enough to handle a broader understanding of knowledge. So, yes, it is possible. I have encountered places where individuals exist without a physical reality as we know it. These individuals have social connections and form a population, but their existence lacks substantial physicality. While they seem to possess bodies and interact in certain ways, the physical aspect of their environment resembles a dream-like reality. It exists, but it is not a dominant factor. This is because their rule set is not as rigid as ours. Their rule set does not account for every minute interaction and its consequences, unlike our own. There are people who inhabit such realities. However, if we focus on physical realities like ours, which adhere to a strict rule set, it becomes evident that every action has an equation, and every occurrence has a reason rooted in the physical processes. Every objective aspect seems to have a physical process behind it, leading to consequences and interactions with others. I have not personally experienced predominantly mental realities, but I suspect..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In your encounters, have you come across realities where individuals primarily engage in nonphysical pursuits and have surpassed the need for physicality? How do these individuals navigate their existence and social connections in the absence of substantial physicality?",
        "agent": "In my experience, I have not encountered places or been to locations that primarily exist in the realm of the mind. It seems that individuals who predominantly operate in the mental realm have surpassed the necessity for physicality and have transitioned to other realms that do not involve physical processes. The physical world, with its inherent processes, serves as a catalyst for interactions and challenges that facilitate personal growth. If everyone were already sufficiently mature, such a process would not be required at the initial stages of development, but rather at more advanced levels. Therefore, I have not come across realities like ours where the majority of individuals engage primarily in nonphysical pursuits."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "All  right, and on to the next question that's one of our previous questions. Are aging, illness and death a necessary part of the rule sets of every virtual reality?",
        "agent": "Yes, but that's all relative when I talk about aging. It is important to acknowledge the process of growing old and eventually dying in our reality. This significance arises because we often find ourselves trapped in a corner of our own beliefs, unwilling to embrace change. We become so attached to our story that we refuse to deviate from it. Consequently, our personal growth stagnates, and we develop a 'been there, done that' attitude towards everything. Our rate of growth slows down significantly. Hence, it is beneficial for our avatar to experience death. Through death, we have the opportunity to start anew, free from biases, beliefs, and fears that hindered us before. We can begin with an entirely different set of circumstances. If, however, we find ourselves painting ourselves into a corner once again, we have another chance to try again. Currently, it seems that our lifespan is around 81 to 100 years, or maybe 71 to 100 years. Some individuals manage to live up to 120 years, while many others pass away before reaching 70. This timeframe appears to be when we tend to get stuck. Perhaps, in the future, we could extend our average lifespan to 200 years. If that were the case, it would be crucial for us to keep our minds open, continue exploring, experimenting, learning, and growing, and avoid confining ourselves..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "To continue expanding our knowledge and avoid stagnation, what actions should we take to keep our minds open and actively engage in experimentation, learning, and growth? How might this level of engagement change as we approach the 200th year or a similar milestone?",
        "agent": "In order to continue evolving and expanding our knowledge, it is crucial for us to keep our minds open and actively engage in experimentation, learning, and growth. This continuous engagement with others allows us to broaden our perspectives and avoid stagnation. It is likely that we would need to maintain this level of engagement until around the 200th year or a similar milestone, where we might find ourselves in a situation where we need to reassess and make necessary changes. I want to emphasize that the current lifespan we have is not a fundamental aspect of our existence. If we look back in history, humans used to have a life expectancy of around 35 years. Those who lived beyond that were considered exceptionally old due to the dangerous nature of life back then. However, advancements in medicine, particularly in the treatment of bacterial infections, have significantly increased our lifespan to around 75 to 80 years. Additionally, our living conditions have improved, and we now have access to more comforts and conveniences that reduce the physical and mental strain on our bodies. Our modern lifestyle is also more forgiving and allows for more leisure time compared to the past. While it is true that we now live longer, there will likely be a limit to our lifespan, where aging eventually leads to death. Unless, of course, the system in place ensures that our avatars continue to grow and improve indefinitely without reaching a plateau. If this were the case, there would be no need for them to start over at any point."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "In the context of growth and progress, what are your thoughts on the idea of starting over or allowing individuals to continue their progress even if the growth rate slows down? How would this approach impact population growth and what factors would need to be considered to maintain balance?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you my perspective on this. If we reach a point where the growth rate of individuals slows down, it wouldn't make sense for them to start over at that point. Instead, we should let them continue their progress. Of course, in such a scenario, the birth rate would have to be very small. We can't keep having births nearly equal deaths, as that would lead to unsustainable population growth. The system would have to juggle many factors in order to maintain balance. However, if people are allowed to age significantly, it would depend on what we actually need. Should we terminate and start over? Is that a beneficial approach? These questions keep stirring the pot and introducing new experiences and choices. Otherwise, we would just keep making the same choices in a stable environment, which doesn't promote much growth. Starting over would provide us with a fresh set of choices and perspectives, leading to higher growth rates. Additionally, it's important to consider that we are products of the virtual reality that has evolved. We, as humans, are just a result of this evolution. Our biology has limitations, and the system doesn't seem to have designed us to live forever. There will always be some constraints on what our biology can support. Perhaps advancements in science and technology can push those limitations, but we should be aware of the inherent limitations of our biology."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Considering the limitations of biology and the potential for genetic engineering to address them, what are your thoughts on the possibility of moving on from our current state and embracing new choices and experiences? How might this approach contribute to personal growth and development?",
        "agent": "In terms of the limitations of biology, it's uncertain how much our science can overcome them. Genetic engineering may offer a solution to the degradation our bodies experience over time, but it's still a distant possibility. We can't say for sure how things will unfold. However, if we find ourselves stuck in a repetitive cycle of making the same choices, there might be a way for us to move on from that avatar and embrace a fresh set of intriguing and challenging choices. The specifics of what that would entail are unknown to me. Nevertheless, the system won't allow us to idle away our time without purpose. And I believe that as we mature, we wouldn't want to do that either."

    {
        "questioner": "Right?  Thank you, Tom. Our next question is, are your children interested in My Big Toe and meditation? And do they do out of body experiences, remote viewing, healing? And did you teach them or just.",
        "agent": "Leave them on their well, all I have four children, two girls, two boys. When I homeschooled my children and My Big Toe, the trilogy was on the reading list, so they had no choice but to read all three of those books. At that age, which was somewhere between about 15 and 17, I didn't try to make them read it when they were ten because that wouldn't have been a very good idea. But between 15 and 17, it was important for them to read those books. Now, my girls weren't particularly interested. They struggled with it and didn't find it very captivating. They were only mildly curious, I guess. The philosophy of the nature of reality just wasn't as significant to them at that age as it was for the boys. The boys, on the other hand, found it much more important. They became genuinely interested and even learned to meditate in their own style. They also learned to use their intent to accomplish a few things. However, in general, I took the last choice you mentioned. I simply let them be. I exposed them to the material and answered their questions if they had any. But I didn't push them or make it a requirement beyond reading the book. It was a good book to spark discussions about life and what truly matters, which should be a part of..."

    {
        "questioner": "How did you introduce the concept of the book 'My Big Toe' to your children and what approach did you take to encourage their exploration of their own interests after reading it?",
        "agent": "To initiate discussions about life and its significance, which should be an integral part of every child's education, I used the book as a tool. Once they finished reading the book and we discussed it thoroughly, they were left to explore their own interests. Currently, neither of my sons regularly meditate, but they both acknowledge the existence of a broader reality and utilize it when necessary. While it doesn't consume a significant portion of their lives, it does play a role. They are occupied with various other responsibilities. One of my sons recently graduated from law school and just started working as a lawyer. He has a wife, two young children, and plenty of tasks to attend to, leaving little time for meditation or contemplating the nature of reality. My other son, who is approaching 50, is contemplating retirement. He also has a young child, a wife, a demanding job, and a one-hour commute to Southern California. His schedule keeps him occupied as well. Therefore, meditation and metaphysical ponderings are not the central focus of my children's lives. However, I must mention that all of my children have attended at least one of my events or workshops. One of my sons even participated in an intensive program I conducted about a year ago. So, they still maintain awareness and involvement on the periphery, but it is not a dominant aspect of their lives, and I am content with that. It is exactly where it should be for them."

        "questioner": "Thanks,  Tom. The next question is have you heard about the math genius Srinivas of Brahmajan? What do you think of him? And who used to receive gorgeous math formulas during his sleep? He said it was a goddess who induced these images for him. He's just asking you probably may not know about him. He's asking what your opinion is of this sort of thing.",
        "agent": "Well, I think this person must have a strong background in mathematics. Only mathematicians or physicists would describe equations as 'gorgeous'. It's not a term that you would typically hear from anyone else. So, based on that, I would say that this person is either a mathematician or a physicist. When the yogi claims that he receives this knowledge from the goddess, it's important to understand that this is just a metaphor. It's the yogi's way of explaining how he accesses and receives this information. He uses the metaphor of the goddess as his tool set and source of knowledge. Now, it's crucial not to take these metaphors too literally, even though they may seem literal to the person experiencing them. The experience of the metaphor is unique to the individual. They interpret the data stream they receive through that metaphor. So, why do they do this? I can think of two possible reasons. Firstly, they might have a deep interest in mathematics and find beauty in equations. They may have a strong intention to receive this kind of information and, with practice and patience, they could develop the ability to do so. They might even come up with solutions to unsolved mathematical problems or proofs. That's one possibility. The other possibility is that the larger consciousness system, which I mentioned earlier, likes to create these unusual experiences for certain individuals to help the rest of us realize that our reality is much stranger than we think. It's a way of waking us up to the possibilities beyond our everyday understanding. So, yes, it's possible to encounter young boys who are eight years old and have a deep understanding of complex mathematical concepts..."

        "questioner": "Can you share some examples of extraordinary occurrences that challenge our understanding of reality and serve as reminders that our perception of the world is limited?",
        "agent": "Our reality is indeed stranger than we initially believed. It's fascinating to consider that even young boys, as young as eight years old, can vividly recount their past lives as World War I pilots. They can recall intricate details such as the pilot's name, the aircraft they flew, and even the location where they were shot down. These extraordinary occurrences are not limited to past-life memories alone. We also encounter instances of twins being born with psychic abilities and various other unexplainable phenomena. These occurrences are scattered across different cultures and serve as wake-up calls for us to recognize the existence of the inexplicable. When we witness things that defy explanation, it opens our eyes to the fact that our reality extends beyond the confines of the objective physical world. Perhaps the system orchestrates these experiences for individuals who perceive equations as beautiful and awe-inspiring. By presenting them with intricate and elegant equations, it prompts others to ponder how they achieve such brilliance. Some may question if a divine entity grants them this knowledge, or if they possess an innate mathematical prowess. These experiences serve as catalysts, awakening people to the realization that the physical realm is not the sole domain of existence. There is more to our reality than meets the eye."

        "questioner": "Thank  you. That sort of reminds me of how Mozart downloaded and had in his mind all of his music that I could attribute the adjective gorgeous to. But that's sort of a phenomenon maybe similar to that. The questioner goes on to say, could this mathematician Srinivasa have access to database? He's asking, is there a database containing the mathematical formulas that govern our virtual reality?",
        "agent": "I don't have knowledge of them being stored in a database, but I know they exist and the knowledge is available. The fundamental rules in the rule set are mathematical, which is why mathematics can easily describe our reality. The rule set contains mathematical equations and logical statements, including if-then statements. This is how a virtual reality is generated. The creators of The Sims, for example, had a team of mathematicians who used math to make the game work and represent physical objects in the virtual world. While I haven't come across a specific database that contains all the equations in the rule set, I believe the information is available. However, the system would only share this information with someone who knows how to ask and receive it. Interestingly, many inventors and individuals who come up with groundbreaking ideas often do so in their minds, finding inspiration without relying on external databases or resources."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do individuals tap into their own personal database of knowledge to access inspiration and creative ideas?",
        "agent": "When I observe individuals, I notice that many of them engage in internal processes that lead to inspiration. It's fascinating how ideas and solutions can suddenly appear in their minds, whether it's during a dream or while they're in a state of deep contemplation. Some may not label it as meditation, but rather as a moment of allowing their thoughts to wander freely. These instances of inspiration are not limited to inventors and scientists; authors who craft stories often experience this as well. They refer to it as being inspired, as if they have received a burst of creativity. In reality, what they are receiving is information from their own data stream that has been synthesized into a plot or solution. It's intriguing to think that many people draw upon a well of knowledge beyond their conscious awareness. We commonly refer to this phenomenon as intuition and inspiration. However, it's important to recognize that this process is simply the act of accessing information that is already available in our personal database. We tap into this information when we have a desire for it, when we actively think about it, and when we are open to receiving it. It's unlikely to occur while engaging in activities that demand our full attention, such as water skiing or playing checkers. Instead, it is during moments of stillness and mental freedom that we are most receptive. By quieting our intellect and allowing our thoughts to flow, we create the optimal conditions for inspiration to arise."

    {
        "questioner": "What are some key factors that contribute to creating a receptive state for tapping into moments of inspiration and accessing intuitive insights?",
        "agent": "To tap into those moments of inspiration, it's important to quiet the mind and let the intellect take a backseat. By dealing with things on an intuitive level, we create the space for new ideas to emerge. However, it's crucial to be in a receptive state, ready to accept these intuitive insights. Without the intention to ask and the willingness to listen at a being level, we may miss out on these valuable inspirations."

        "questioner": "Thank  you. The next question is from Mary. My question is about fear and how to best overcome it. When the fear is caused by events that happened when I was too young to remember, it's so clear to me that this fear is holding me back, but I just can't find escape from it. There are moments when I see a bigger picture, but these moments are few and far between.",
        "agent": "Okay, when you have fear but can't remember its source because you were too young, it can be challenging to understand what exactly you're afraid of. However, that's perfectly fine. The most important thing you need in this situation is courage. So, when you find yourself in a situation where fear makes you recoil, prevents you from reaching out, makes you hide, keeps you quiet, or even makes you angry, it's crucial to acknowledge that fear. You're already aware that you have fear, which is a great starting point. Now, you must gather the courage to tell yourself that you won't let fear control you. It's not about simply acting differently, but about fundamentally changing your mindset. Let's say you're afraid to trust others or meet new people. When you come across an opportunity to get closer to someone, but it requires trust, and you feel the urge to withdraw, that's when you need to catch yourself and say, 'No, I won't be that way. I will trust.' Instead of retreating, you must move forward and embrace that relationship or connection. Over time, you'll notice that the fear starts to fade away as trust grows. It takes courage to resist reacting to fear and to let it go. By letting go of fear, I mean that when fear arises and tells you to run away, to avoid danger, and to not get involved, you choose to get involved anyway. You take the next step, and then the step after that..."

        "questioner": "When faced with fear that stems from events you can't remember due to your young age, how can you gather the courage to confront and overcome that fear? What steps can you take to resist reacting to fear and let it go, even when it becomes more intimidating and scary?",
        "agent": "I get involved here. And instead, I choose to take the next step after that step and the next step after that. If I have the courage to not react to my fear, I will eventually overcome it. However, the tough part is that once my fear realizes that I am not paying attention to it and that I am letting go of its hold on me, it will become even more intimidating and scary. The fear doesn't want to be thrown out, so it will try to make itself appear bigger and uglier. But I won't let that stop me. I will stand up and deal with it. It takes courage to face fear head-on, and that courage comes from having a strong intent to get rid of the fear. If my intent is strong at a being level, not just intellectual, I will be able to overcome it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you develop the courage to confront and overcome fear, especially when it becomes more intimidating and scary? What steps can you take to resist reacting to fear and let it go?",
        "agent": "Being level is crucial in overcoming fear. It's not just an intellectual process; it requires a deep understanding at the core of your being. If you approach it solely from an intellectual standpoint, you'll likely give in to fear quickly. However, when you address it at a being level, you become resilient and capable of walking away from your fears. It's important to note that this transformation won't happen overnight. In fact, the first ten attempts may not yield the desired results. But you must persist and have the courage to keep going. With time, you'll begin to see progress. The grip of fear will gradually loosen until it eventually disappears completely. Once you conquer your fear, you'll experience a profound sense of relief that will stay with you forever."

        "questioner": "Thank  you. One more question from the MBT forum users. Actually, there's a couple more that we have left over. Can you give someone an experience of an encounter with the LCS?",
        "agent": "I can share an encounter I had with the LCS, but I cannot provide someone with the same experience. Experiencing the LCS is something that individuals have to seek on their own. However, I can transmit thoughts, feelings, and attitudes to someone by entering their mind, although it would not be identical. This would be a distinct process. The connection I perceive with the LCS is an experience where I merge with the larger system, becoming one with it. In this state, I feel complete and overwhelming love, being connected to every aspect of existence, from blades of grass to leaves on trees. I am aware of everything and feel a profound sense of tranquility and peace. The amount of love I experience is simply overpowering. In this state, I lose my individuality and no longer identify as Tom Campbell or anyone else. I am just a part of everything, connected to all and everyone through love. This is an experience that one can have, which I refer to as getting up close and personal with the larger consciousness system. It is often a life-changing experience, and some near-death experiences (NDEs) may lead to this state, although it is only a small percentage of them."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can someone establish a connection with the larger conscious system and have a profound encounter with it? What are the prerequisites and preparations one needs to make in order to experience this life-changing event?",
        "agent": "In my research on near-death experiences (NDEs), I have found that some individuals do have profound experiences of connecting with a larger conscious system. Although not all NDEs result in this, it is still a significant aspect for a small percentage of people. The system reveals to them the true essence of the bigger picture. If one intends to establish a connection with the larger conscious system and genuinely desires to experience it, they can have that profound encounter. The larger conscious system refers to a state of oneness, where individuals transcend their intellectual understanding and approach it from a deeper level of being. It is not merely a wish, but a sincere intention that stems from the core of one's being. If one is truly prepared for such an experience, the system will grant it to them, and it can be a life-changing event. However, if someone were to try to give this experience to another person, it would only be a mere shadow of the real thing. Similarly, describing the experience, as I just did, may sound intriguing, but it cannot capture the true essence of actually having the experience. It is important to note that this is not an uncommon occurrence. Thousands of individuals have reported having such experiences, and it aligns with the concept of nirvana in Indian, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions. The state of bliss and unity with everything is not limited to a select few; anyone can potentially experience it. It does not require years of practice or preparation. One simply needs to be open to it, make a sincere request, and be ready for it. During my immersives, I have often observed one or two, sometimes even three individuals..."

        "questioner": "The next question is about dark matter, which I've spoken about before. There's a video of Tom being asked about dark matter, and he dismissed it as physicists making up equations to keep materialism alive. While I agree that most physicists are materialists, I don't agree with Tom's dismissal of dark matter as a measured phenomenon. Gravity has been measured in the universe with no physical cause seemingly present, and the stars and planets in galaxies don't produce enough gravity to keep them together. Dark matter is just a name given to whatever is producing this extra gravity. From a simulation perspective, it's possible that dark matter was added as a rule to keep galaxies together. The same explanation could be used for dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. I'd like to hear your views or alternate ideas on this.",
        "agent": "Okay. Actually, I agree with the person who wrote that. We have the same understanding, just different terminology. If we consider dark matter as the mysterious entity that enables galaxies to spin despite the insufficient gravitational force from visible stars, then yes, it can be seen as part of the rule set. Dark matter is necessary for the coherence and longevity of the universe, allowing for the evolution of life. So, it is indeed a requirement for the stability of the simulation. However, it's important to note that just because it's part of the rule set doesn't mean there is a physical entity causing it. That's where the distinction lies. Physicists don't simply make up forces to compensate for equations that don't work or galaxies that don't hold together. They propose the existence of an invisible force based on scientific evidence and observations. While they don't use the word 'magic,' it's similar in the sense that it's an unobservable force that explains a phenomenon. The real world is not accurately modeled by continuous functions because it is too complex."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the concept of dark matter and dark energy in more detail, and how they contribute to the stability and expansion of the universe?",
        "agent": "Well, physicists never use the word magic, but they are referring to something similar. There is an unknown force that we don't understand, yet it is responsible for keeping the galaxies together. I don't have any issues with that because it's part of the rule set. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a physical entity in this reality that is causing it. The same goes for dark energy, which is the additional energy that drives the expansion of the universe. In fact, the expansion is accelerating, and we don't have a good reason for it yet. I would say it's just another aspect of the rule set. Expanding space is easy to simulate mathematically. For example, I can write an equation for a sphere: R squared equals x squared plus Y squared plus Z squared. By using a do loop in a small laptop computer, I can continuously increase the values of X, Y, and Z, making the space expand. In less than a minute, I can have a simulated universe in the computer that is larger than our entire physical universe."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain how computer simulations can be used to create a universe larger than our physical universe and simulate its expansion? How does this relate to the concept of dark matter and dark energy?",
        "agent": "In the realm of computer simulations, I can create a universe that is much larger than our physical universe by using simple equations and increasing the exponent until the computer can no longer handle it. I can even make it expand with acceleration. It doesn't require any physical substance that we can't perceive or measure. Instead, we can attribute the expansion to an unknown force that causes it and holds galaxies together. We don't have to invent a new type of matter like dark matter to explain it. We just need to acknowledge the existence of this force and the presence of an invisible energy that drives the acceleration."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the concept of dark matter and dark energy in relation to the expansion of the universe? How do these phenomena fit into the rule set governing our universe?",
        "agent": "I can't see it, but let's call it dark matter. The acceleration we observe is caused by some unknown invisible energy. However, attributing physical properties to explain these phenomena may not necessarily be true. Perhaps one day, we will discover a physical entity responsible for this. It's possible that dark energy or dark matter may not be as elusive as we think, and we might be able to measure it. If that happens, I would fully support understanding its nature and origin. But for now, we simply don't have that knowledge. All we know is that there is a force driving these events. Instead of immediately assuming it must be a physical entity, let's consider it as part of the rule set governing our universe. These rules are necessary for the longevity, stability, and conducive environment required for the evolution of our universe. Let's leave it at that. Making up physical entities just because we lack understanding and believe everything must be physical is what I object to. That's why I playfully challenged scientists by suggesting they insert physical entities into their equations. My intention was to highlight the tendency to rely on physical explanations when they may not be warranted. So, in essence, I agree with the person who posed this question. Dark matter and dark energy are simply attributes of the rule set governing our universe."

    {
        "questioner": "Can you provide your perspective on the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Are they simply attributes of the rule set governing our universe, or do you believe they have a physical existence?",
        "agent": "I completely agree with the person who wrote this question. These attributes are simply part of the rule set, nothing more. As of now, it would be an overstatement to claim that they are physical. Let's acknowledge their existence and perhaps we will gain further understanding in the future. Alternatively, we may never fully comprehend them. It is possible that these attributes are just minor adjustments the system had to incorporate into the rule set to ensure its functionality."

        "questioner": "All  right, thank you. One last question from our leftover questions. This one is from Claudio. And Claudio says the sun broadcasts information in all directions em radiations, including. Photons. Our dreams are more efficient virtual realities. We can just think of the sun, and it appears it starts from the observer asking a question in PMR. Starts from the object observed sending information out that can sometimes reach an observer. Have you seen more efficient virtual realities using this concept? Information starting from the observer? Do you agree that this way is more efficient than PMR? And do you know why PMR wasn't done starting from observers instead of from virtual objects sending information out?",
        "agent": "Alright, let me clarify things, Claudio. In this virtual reality, the sun is not a real sun, but rather a virtual representation. According to the rule set of this virtual world, the sun emits energy in the form of particles like photons and protons, which is referred to as the solar wind. It's interesting to note that in this virtual reality, one could construct a large sailing ship in space that reflects this solar wind, allowing it to propel through space, similar to how physical wind propels ships on water. However, it's important to understand that these particles are also virtual, just like the entire reality itself. The sun and the particles don't exist in a physical sense; they are merely data produced by the rule set and transmitted to the players. This tight rule set governs all energy interactions within this reality, including cellular metabolism and other energetic processes. As a result, this virtual reality is highly interactive. Our actions have consequences, and we are influenced by the actions of others. Even the sun, despite its massive size compared to anything else in this virtual world, can be influenced to some extent. For example, if we were able to redirect a massive asteroid towards the sun, it might cause a slight disturbance in its motion. However, due to the sun's immense mass, the effect would be minimal and temporary. Nevertheless, the possibility of such interactions between different elements within this virtual reality is intriguing..."

    {
        "questioner": "In this virtual reality, you mentioned that the sun and other objects are not physical but rather virtual representations. Can you explain how this virtual reality allows you to create and manipulate objects like the sun to serve your purposes?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you about the kind of reality we're dealing with here. It's a reality where everything is interactive with everything else, all according to a tight rule set. This rule set describes all the energy exchanges and creates a highly interactive environment. That's why we have causality in this objective world. Every event has a cause, and it's all because of this tight rule set. Now, let's talk about a different kind of reality, like a dream reality. In a dream, I can simply think up a sun whenever I want. It's a common tool I use when I'm healing people. I visualize reaching out into outer space, grabbing a sun, and placing it in the body where I want to heal. This sun generates bright white light, illuminating the dark areas. Of course, it's just a metaphor, but in my reality, a sun represents a dynamo of energy and brightness. By visualizing this sun, I'm energizing and transforming the dark spots into light. So, in my dream reality, I can create and manipulate the properties of objects like the sun to serve my purposes."

    {
        "questioner": "In this dream reality where you have the power to manifest things and shape your own reality, can you explain how the rule set differs from the tightly regulated system in the objective world? How does this flexibility in the rule set allow you to create and manipulate objects like the sun to serve your purposes?",
        "agent": "In my reality where I'm healing, if I'm dreaming, I might imagine the presence of a sun. It's not about efficiency, but rather the fact that in the dream reality and in my reality where I'm healing, there are no strict rules. It's not a tightly regulated system. Things operate differently here. Not every interaction is calculated, and not everything necessarily affects each other. It's simply a different kind of virtual reality. It's not a matter of one being more efficient than the other. Creating a dream reality around a single player is indeed much more efficient. Most dream realities are like single-player games. The consciousness receives a data stream from the larger consciousness system, which defines what it calls the dream. Often, this data stream consists of dream-like interactions that offer choices for personal growth. So, we've transitioned from a multiplayer game in this physical universe, where we all interact with each other, to mostly a single-player game where we interact with the computer. Occasionally, we may encounter someone in our dreams, resulting in two individuals interacting with the computer. However, it's not the same game. It doesn't have to compute all the interactions from every action being taken. Moreover, in this virtual reality, you have the power to manifest things and shape your own reality. It's not about efficiency; it's about running a virtual reality with a more flexible rule set."

    {
        "questioner": "In this dream reality where you have the power to manifest things and shape your own reality, can you explain how the rule set differs from the tightly regulated system in the objective world? How does this flexibility in the rule set allow you to create and manipulate objects like the sun to serve your purposes?",
        "agent": "The way I run a virtual reality is with a very loose rule set. If I want to run a virtual reality with a very tight rule set, I have to calculate all the interactions of everything. That's what a rule set means. If I have more rules, I have a lot of calculations to do. If I have fewer rules, then I don't. So there isn't a fundamental way of approaching virtual reality that is more efficient. The same kind of approach that I use in dreams or when I'm healing would be a lot more efficient if the physical world were that way. However, the physical world can't be defined that way. The physical world is defined with a more detailed rule set. So that seems to be the problem there. Maybe we're comparing apples to oranges. Maybe you're comparing apples to oranges in that thing. But yes, I can make sons, and those sons can have attributes. However, running a single player game between me and the LCS, as opposed to running a multiplayer game with seven and a half billion people, is just a different animal altogether. One of them is very detailed in all of its interactions. The Rule set sends us data that describes that solar wind. It sends us data that describes the ultraviolet rays we get to tan our skin. The Rule set just sends that to us. It's not that we have skin and that it gets tan. We have virtual skin on an avatar. The Rule set lets that skin get tan because of those particles coming from the sun. It's not that the sun is somehow..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the rule set in virtual reality determine the skin's response to sunlight, and what factors influence the causality of tanning in this context?",
        "agent": "In the realm of virtual reality, the process of tanning is not a result of the sun directly interacting with the skin. Instead, it is governed by a set of rules that determine the skin's response based on the presence of sunlight. If the rule set dictates that the sun is shining, the skin will either turn red or brown accordingly. Therefore, the only factor that influences causality in virtual reality is the rule set itself."
