        "questioner": "Welcome to another episode of \"Your Soul Purpose\" with Dr. John Filo. Today, we have the pleasure of having Tom Campbell as our guest. We explore various fascinating topics, including the difference between intellect and emotion as modes of expression for consciousness. We discuss how finding a balance between thought and intuition can elevate our consciousness and lead us to love and serving others. We also touch on the path of enlightenment and the euphoric state experienced during meditation, where one feels connected to everything. Additionally, we delve into the concept of cultural reincarnation and how it enriches the soul DNA and indicates an elevated level of consciousness. For those interested in the left-brain perspective, we explore the idea of time and its relation to the larger consciousness system. Overall, it was a rich and insightful discussion. Now, let's dive into the topic of intellect versus emotion within the context of MBT. What determines whether a free awareness unit expresses dominance in one or the other? Is it a result of the avatar's constraints or something inherent in the nature of the IUOC?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you, emotions are a fascinating form of expression. They can be conveyed through words, language, gestures, body positions, and of course, emotions themselves. Emotions serve as an output, a mode of expression for the individuated unit of consciousness or the free will awareness unit. Unlike the intellect, which can be a bit deceptive, emotions originate from the very core of our being. When we experience a feeling, it is a direct representation of our innermost state. On the other hand, the intellect tends to be influenced by our beliefs, ego, and fears. It often distorts reality, glossing over uncomfortable truths and disregarding anything that challenges our preconceived notions. As a result, it is less connected to our true being. Now, let's dive into an intriguing concept in psychology: the subconscious. According to Freud, our conscious mind represents the ego, while the subconscious lies beneath it, largely hidden from our awareness. It's a mysterious place where things happen without our conscious knowledge. Occasionally, these hidden thoughts and desires bubble up into our conscious mind, but for the most part, they remain concealed. It's where the ID resides, housing our primal instincts such as sexuality and hunger. Being human certainly comes with its complexities..."

        "questioner": "What is the relationship between the subconscious and our true essence? How does the subconscious manifest and what role does it play in our emotions and feelings?",
        "agent": "Your sexual desires, hunger, and all the basic instinctual aspects of being a human animal are part of us. They reside within us. On the other hand, at the highest level, there is the superego, which is not about the self but about others. It represents the bigger picture. Now, the subconscious, which we are not fully aware of, is not a fundamental part of consciousness. It exists because there are certain things that we would rather not confront, things that are not easily dealt with. These are the things we prefer to keep hidden. Consequently, these hidden aspects end up in our subconscious. Thus, there are numerous emotions and feelings residing in the depths of our subconscious, at the level of our being. However, when we eliminate fear, ego, and the associated beliefs, the subconscious ceases to exist. We become fully aware. We become a unified entity that is conscious of everything. We are aware of our hunger, our sexuality, our needs, our drives, and our desires. None of these aspects are concealed from us. Our feelings, our emotions, everything is laid bare. Essentially, the subconscious becomes a pathological manifestation resulting from fear, ego, and the beliefs that individuals hold. Therefore, when we separate our intellect, which is who we think we are or who we aspire to be, from our feelings, which are our true essence, nobody consciously decides, 'I think I should be angry now.' That simply does not happen. Anger arises naturally..."

    {
        "questioner": "How can our dreams and emotions provide insights into our true essence and consciousness? Can you explain the connection between our dreams, emotions, and our being level of consciousness?",
        "agent": "I went to the park and played with my dog. It's not that you have decided that you're going to get angry. Anger just roars up out of you. So if you want to have a good idea of where you are on this consciousness evolution scale, pay attention to your feelings. Also pay attention to your dreams. Dreams are the same way in your dreams. Well, regular dreams, dreams that are not lucid. Your intellect is not in charge. You're not thinking before you act. You're acting right out of the being level. So the way you interact, the choices you make in dreams are really the way you are, that's you at the being level because now it's a lucid dream. Now you're back to the intellects in charge. But regular dreams are much like emotions in that sense. They come straight out of the being level. Now there's a little confusion between the intellectual level and the being level often because we talk about the intellectual level as your thinking, your rational part. But that's not really true. When you get rid of fear and you have no ego and beliefs, you still can think. It's not like, well, your intellectual level that's making up stories and justifying everything. You let go of using it for that. It's no longer used to justify and to make up stories that make you feel better and so on. But you still have a cognitive function. You still have the ability to think and analyze and weigh and consider and judge and all those things are there. They're just not used for self-serving purposes."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the relationship between our intellectual level and our being level? How does our thinking, analyzing, weighing, considering, and judging function when we reach a state without ego and fear?",
        "agent": "When we reach a state where our ego and fear are absent, our ability to think, analyze, weigh, consider, and judge remains intact. However, at this point, we are thinking from our being level, where our intellectual part is just one aspect of our whole being. We are no longer fragmented into separate parts, but rather unified as a complete being. This being encompasses cognitive function, emotional function, instincts, sexuality, and other aspects, all interconnected and in harmony with each other. This is a glimpse into the psychology of the being level and the intellectual level."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Does  the data. I mean, if consciousness is a data stream so the data stream has a quality that can evoke emotion and also has a quality that can evoke intellect is what you're saying.",
        "agent": "Yeah, well, I don't know that it evoked intellect. The intellect can be brought to bear on it. But yes, it has qualities that evoke emotion. And when we play video games, it's the same way, right? We get a data stream from the computer and we will see something that touches us emotionally on the computer screen and we immediately have emotions to connect to that. So there's part of our natural expression of who we are, of what we are. That comes out as emotional. It comes out in a feeling space rather than intellectual space. So we function in both of those modes simultaneously. We think about it, oh, what a sad thing. Maybe that's our intellect. But then we emotionally connect to it in a feeling space. So we operate in both the thinking and the feeling simultaneously, just different modes. And yes, those pixels on the screen, we interpret those to be something that we think about being sad and that we feel sad about at the same time. Or we have empathy. Now, empathy is a connection to another person in a feeling space, not so much in an intellectual space. I guess you can have intellectual empathy where you'd look at somebody and then you'd consider their situation and intellectually feel some kind of thing for them, but see, again, feel some kind of thing for them. Empathy is really out of your feeling space. It's caring about another. So all of those become just one thing that's all aware of each other and all pulling together, all working together. Now, the last part of our experience, the part that we often overlook, is the connection to the larger consciousness system. This is the part that goes beyond our individual selves and connects us to something greater. It's the part that allows us to tap into the collective wisdom and knowledge of all beings. It's the part that reminds us that we are not alone in this vast universe. So when we engage with video games or any other form of media, we are not just interacting with the pixels on the screen or the characters in the game. We are also connecting with the consciousness that created it, the consciousness that is experiencing it alongside us. And in that connection, we find a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world."

    {
        "questioner": "In the context of the Freudian model and the MBT viewpoint, can you explain the difference between the superego and the ego, and how they influence our behaviors and motivations?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you, folks, we're all in this together. We need to work together, support each other, and be aware of each other's needs. Now, let's talk about the Freudian model. The superego, according to Freud, is what we should strive to be. It's all about love, care, and putting others before ourselves. Freud developed this model by observing people and their behaviors. He noticed that most people are driven by their egos, controlled by their intellect, and motivated by fear. And you know what? That's just how most people are. Freud believed that this ego-driven behavior is normal and necessary. But here's the thing, folks, it's not true. In the MBT viewpoint, we see things differently. We believe that the superego, the part that's all about others, is the healthy part. That's what we should aim to become. On the other hand, the ego is mostly driven by fear and ego beliefs, and that's what we need to let go of. But hey, we're not throwing away our intellectual function. No, sir! We're just redirecting it. Instead of serving our fears, it will serve others. And th..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can we overcome the influence of fear and redirect our focus towards serving others rather than ourselves, in order to achieve a state of self-awareness and become driven solely by our superego?",
        "agent": "To prevent our fear from controlling us, we must shift our focus towards serving others rather than ourselves. This transformation will result in a fully integrated being, devoid of any subconscious influence and driven solely by our superego. As a result, we will become highly self-aware, capable of critical analysis, rational thinking, and fair judgment. However, our judgment will no longer be rooted in a sense of superiority over others, as that mindset is rooted in fear. Instead, we will evaluate situations based on how we can best contribute and be a part of the solution."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Here  is someone who is more inclined to be emotional. Is that someone that has broken through the layers, has evolved, or is a higher level of a consciousness, would you say?",
        "agent": "Well, let me reiterate my point. In terms of the emotional and intellectual aspects, some individuals excel in one mode more than the other. For instance, there are those who are highly expressive and skilled in the emotional mode, but not as much in the intellectual mode. On the other hand, some individuals are so deeply engrossed in their intellectual pursuits that they may not even be aware of their emotions. Whenever an emotion arises, they suppress it because they perceive it as illogical and hindering their problem-solving abilities. This suppression of emotions is a common practice. Moreover, this differentiation can also be observed in the left brain-right brain concept. There are individuals who approach the world through a logical, step-by-step process, and there are those who have a holistic perspective. It's not about following a linear path from step A to step B to step C; it's about grasping the bigger picture, understanding the essence, and identifying the crucial aspects. They intuitively comprehend the path from A to B without the need for a logical process. These are just two different ways of utilizing the intellectual part, which can be further divided into two parts. The individuals who are more right-brained and intuitive also tend to rely more on their feelings rather than logical processes. This is why I brought up the connection between the two. It's all interconnected."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain the different approaches individuals have towards emotions and intellect, and how these approaches can lead to extremes in terms of reliance on logical thinking or emotional intuition?",
        "agent": "Because they're not into the logical process, I brought that up. It's all interconnected. People who are left-brained and rely heavily on logical thinking tend to disregard the importance of emotions and intuition. They believe that relying on feelings and intuition can lead them astray and take them to undesirable places. The only thing they trust is their intellect, so they become highly intellectual individuals. They live in their heads and often claim not to have many emotions or that emotions don't affect them significantly. Emotions are present in their lives, but they don't have a significant impact. Their lives revolve around their intellect. On the other extreme, we know people who are highly emotional and don't engage in logical thinking. They rely solely on their feelings and intuition. We sometimes mock them by calling them airheads or overly emotional. Similarly, we make fun of intellectuals by labeling them as cybers, as they often act more like computers than humans. These extremes exist because we have different ways of expressing ourselves, and some individuals tend to focus more on one aspect than others. However, it is ideal to strive for balance, where all aspects are equally developed. By achieving balance, we can transcend the limitations of the ego..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can achieving balance between emotions and intellect enhance your decision-making process and overall experience of reality?",
        "agent": "Being balanced is the key. When I have all aspects of myself in harmony, everything falls into place. By letting go of ego, fear, and limiting beliefs, I create the conditions for true balance. Now, my intellect serves love instead of fear, and my emotions are aligned. My intuition becomes a powerful tool, providing insights from multiple levels of existence, not just the physical realm. I connect with others on a deeper level, transcending the superficial. This integration allows me to make decisions from a broader perspective, tapping into different facets of my being. I can be logical when necessary, like when I need to find my lost glasses by retracing my steps. I can also engage in scientific discourse and comprehend complex mathematical concepts. Simultaneously, I remain intuitive and empathetic, attuned to the emotions of those around me. Emotion and intellect coexist within me, blending seamlessly to navigate the reality I find myself in. It's not a matter of one being superior to the other; rather, it's about embracing the full spectrum of human experience."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do emotion and intellect contribute to the uniqueness of our individual experiences within this virtual reality?",
        "agent": "In this virtual reality, we have various ways to express ourselves. It's important to note that neither emotion nor intellect is inherently superior or inferior. Both have their own value and significance. Emotion allows us to connect with our experiences on a deeper level, while intellect provides us with logical reasoning and analysis. These different modes of expression contribute to the uniqueness of our individual experiences within this virtual reality."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Which  brings me to the point of in the context of Enlightenment, spiritualists describe the experience as an expansive state of bliss or an ecstasy where tears are flowing uncontrollably as you awaken to this greater presence of Godhead, as it's often referred to. But in MBT, you describe point consciousness rather as a starting point. Have you in your experience Tom, in that point consciousness state, have you experienced an intensity similar to that which can be described as that emotional blissful state? Is that something that you've experienced?",
        "agent": "Oh,  yes, sure. That's basically available whenever you'd like to have it. It's not a difficult thing to experience. It's just opening yourself up to that. And that is a very worthwhile experience. It's more worthwhile the very first time you have it because now it's a big AHA moment and it opens things to you. You've suddenly realized the capacity that you have, what you're a part of. You get all this realization kind of floods in. So it's a bigger deal, maybe the first four or 510 times you do that. But after that it's just an available state and you can kind of be one with the larger consciousness system. And in this state, you feel like you and everything else are all integrated. You're a part of everything. You understand the grass and the leaves on the trees and all the people and everything. You are part of it and it's a part of you and you feel connectedness to everything. And it's this big feeling of oneness. Of course there's no fear in that state. There's no ego in that state. Because if there were fear and ego, you wouldn't be in that state. And for people who just get it momentarily, they drop that fear and ego for a while, they let it go and then they pick it back up again. Because that's really part of is it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "A  mandatory state to experience what inclusivity feels like? Can you get there without experiencing that state?",
        "agent": "Yes, you can reach that state without having to go through the entire process. Experiencing it all at once is a much more intense and profound experience. It's like reaching the peak of a mountain, an unforgettable moment that never loses its magic. You won't find yourself saying, 'I wish I could remember that from 20 years ago,' because you'll remember every single detail, no matter how much time has passed. It's one of those experiences that leaves a lasting impression. However, it's important to note that reaching that state is not necessary. You can still gain an understanding that you are deeply connected to everything around you, that there is an interactive relationship between you and the world. You can even get a sense of what it feels like to be a blade of grass or a leaf on a tree. It's a slightly different experience from the overwhelming rush of getting it all at once. When you approach it gradually, you can still reach that state, just without the same level of intensity. The more you explore and embrace the newness of it, the more profound the experience becomes. It may not be as mind-blowing as the first time, but it's still available to you whenever you desire. It's not about constantly seeking that 'wow' factor, but rather finding moments of centering and grounding. Even if it's just for a few seconds, tapping into that state can bring you back to your core when you feel a bit off-balance."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How can you quickly regain your balance and find your center when you feel a bit off-center? Is there a specific technique or practice that helps you tap into that state?",
        "agent": "When I feel a little off-center and want to regain my balance, I find that going to the centering place helps. It only takes about ten or 20 seconds because all the previous times I've done it come rushing back, along with the current experience. It's like reliving all those moments at once. And somehow, in that process, I find myself centered again. It's a great state to be in, but it's not essential. You can still evolve, grow, and let go of your ego and fear without it. However, the more you let go of your fear, the more likely you are to experience that centeredness. It's like it's right there, within reach. All you have to do is open yourself up to it."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "That  was my next question was is it something that you can just holding that point state of consciousness or is it something that is practiced in your day to day life as well that gets you there?",
        "agent": "Well, I guess you get there when you're ready. You get there when all the necessary influences align perfectly and suddenly, there it is. One of those influences is being in a state free from agitation, ego, fear, or any other factors that hinder your progress. You need to be in a state where you're not preoccupied with the physical reality because that would divert your attention from reaching that state. This requires a sort of meditative state where you let go of the physical aspects. Initially, it may take a few seconds to achieve this state. However, with practice, you can easily and quickly detach yourself from the physical world. That's why I say it can be done in as little as half a minute. Once you've experienced that state, you don't have to go through the entire process again. You can reach that state more effortlessly the next time. It's just a matter of practice and commitment. You don't necessarily have to enter a meditative state, but you do need to let go of any thoughts or distractions related to the physical world because they can be quite distracting. Additionally, you must not be driven by ego or fear. Beliefs can also trap you and keep you grounded in this reality. Lastly, you need to have the intention to explore existence, whether you refer to it as the larger consciousness system, God, or any other term you prefer..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "To achieve a state of oneness with the larger consciousness system or God, what factors need to align and what mindset should you have in order to open yourself to that experience?",
        "agent": "Existence, or you could say the larger consciousness system or God, or however you want to put it. But you have to have the intent to experience yourself as not disconnected from that, but as that. You want to experience everything that's available to you as consciousness. If you have that intent and the necessary conditions in place, then the experience should come to you. However, if you have everything in place but never express the intent to do so, then you won't achieve it. You may be growing up and doing just fine, but you've never really thought about experiencing oneness with the source. Not everyone thinks about it, which may indicate a fear or simply not considering it. Ego can be positive and negative. It can manifest as being a wallflower or an arrogant bully. It could be that you don't feel worthy or believe that it's something you could experience. Your own sense of unworthiness is ego and fear, and that can hinder your progress. Many factors need to align, but once they do, opening yourself to the experience becomes quite natural. Like most experiences, they start off as significant events, become more manageable over time, and eventually..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "What is the nature of significance and how does it evolve over time for certain experiences?",
        "agent": "When it comes to certain experiences, they tend to have different levels of significance depending on where you are in life. Initially, these experiences are monumental, like riding a roller coaster for the first time when you're eight years old. It's the most thrilling thing that has ever happened to you. However, as time goes on and you ride more roller coasters, the novelty wears off. You become familiar with the twists and turns, and it becomes predictable. The excitement diminishes, and you no longer have that rush of anticipation. It's just another ride. But that doesn't mean it's any less important. In fact, it may even become more significant than before. The first time you ride, you're so overwhelmed that you don't know how to react or process the experience. It's just a sensory overload. But as you ride more, you start to understand the mechanics, the sensations, and how everything fits together. You gain a deeper appreciation for the ride and derive more satisfaction from it. With time, it becomes more meaningful rather than less. It's just that the initial thrill and excitement fade away. You don't experience the same level of exhilaration that you..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the significance of certain experiences change over time, and why is it important to recognize this evolution?",
        "agent": "The significance of this matter will become more apparent as time progresses. There is no need to rush, as there is not the same level of excitement as before."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Does  it serve as a fire or a spark for you to follow a specific path in your life or to be more intense towards a specific cause or purpose?",
        "agent": "Yes, it does. And it does that because it provides such a profound sense of centeredness. It's as if you have a crystal-clear understanding of reality and your place within it. Any lingering confusion or doubt simply vanishes. You feel deeply connected to everything around you. You have a profound sense of purpose and direction. Everything feels right. You're doing the best you can with the resources and knowledge you have at any given moment, and that's all you can ask for. As a result, you stop second-guessing yourself. You let go of the need to control every little detail. It's as if everything falls into place effortlessly. You gain a broader perspective, a bigger picture. You trust that everything will work out in the end. You accept yourself for who you are and embrace the journey ahead, knowing that you'll learn and grow along the way. That's just the way it is. Instead of getting caught up in the minutiae of life, worrying about every little outcome, you rise above it all. You transcend the need for constant analysis and control. You operate on a higher level, where everything is in perfect harmony. It doesn't mean that things will always go according to plan or that you'll achieve the desired outcome. It simply means that you're fully engaged in the process of life. You're actively participating and seizing the opportunities for growth and learning, regardless of the outcome. Whether you succeed or fail, it's all part of the journey."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When engaging in an activity, what should you prioritize: the process or the outcome? How can focusing on the process rather than the outcome help you gain valuable insights and stay centered?",
        "agent": "When you engage in an activity, it's important to focus on the process rather than the outcome. Whether you do it well or not, the key is to learn from it. By paying attention and doing your best, you can gain valuable insights. The details that used to worry you will no longer hold importance. The pressure is lifted off your shoulders. The way you approach challenges and how you handle them matters more than the actual outcome. This mindset allows you to let go of unnecessary stress and stay centered. When you find yourself getting too caught up in something or feeling overwhelmed, it's helpful to find your center. This helps you let go of trivial matters and stay focused on the bigger picture. It doesn't provide a step-by-step guide to success, but it connects you to a broader perspective and helps you understand your role in the grand scheme of things. As an individual who is constantly growing..."

    {
        "questioner": "How can focusing on the process rather than the outcome help you gain a broader perspective and align with your purpose in your personal growth journey?",
        "agent": "Experiencing the bigger picture allows you to fully grasp the entirety of it and understand your role within it. As you continue to learn and overcome your fears, you will feel a sense of alignment with your purpose. This alignment signifies that you are exactly where you are meant to be in your personal growth journey."

    {
        "questioner": "And  like you said, there needs to be this balance point because you can't think your way there, obviously, and you can't be extremely emotional and try to get there because then you're going to sort of have a bit of insecurity, or maybe a lot of insecurity for that matter. But you need to balance yourself first. Find that nexus point, if you will. I guess my question is when you see as a parent looking at, for example, your child and you see that they are inclined to be one way versus the other, is your job I mean, some schools of thought say, focus on their strengths. That child tends to be a good, logical, analytical thinker, or that child has a great way to connect with people, she's very emotional, or this or that. Is our job as a parent try to bring them to that balance point? Or is our job to allow them to sort of leverage the strength?",
        "agent": "Both. Yeah, it's both. What would be wrong to do is to try to push or pull them in one direction or the other. In other words, let's say they excel in logical processing. Well, that's good. And I believe in encouraging their strengths because that's who they are. Being true to oneself is much less stressful than trying to conform to someone else's expectations. So, I try to foster their logical process while also ensuring that their intuitive side, their caring side, and their emotional side are also nurtured. I spend time discussing their feelings and thoughts, even when there's no logical way to arrive at an answer. Sometimes, they have to rely on their intuition or explore alternative approaches. I particularly focus on this with young children because they are naturally intuitive. As they grow older, they tend to suppress their intuition and rely more on their intellect. However, if I can help them maintain their intuition while also developing their intellect, they can truly be themselves. We all have different strengths and tendencies, and it's important to embrace who we are rather than trying to be someone else. It's like how, in the past, left-handed people were forced to conform..."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "As a parent, when you notice that your child has a natural inclination towards a certain strength or tendency, should you focus on nurturing that strength or should you also encourage them to explore the opposite side and develop other skills?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you a story. It's like when people used to believe that being left-handed was wrong. They would try to force left-handed individuals to use their right hand instead. 'Hold the pen with your right hand,' they would say. 'Eat with your right hand.' It caused a lot of frustration and didn't feel natural or right. But eventually, people learned to use both hands, which turned out to be a good thing. So, yes, it's okay to use your left hand, but it's also important to be able to use your right hand. You don't want to go through life only being able to use one hand. You want to be versatile. However, if you excel in one hand over the other, that's perfectly fine. Use what comes naturally to you. It's just the way you're wired. Some of it is just part of the way things work. So, I would say encourage people's natural inclinations, but also encourage them to explore the opposite side. You can do this in subtle ways. It's not about giving an intellectual lecture on the non-intellectual side of things. It's about expressing emotions, connecting with others, and helping them develop empathy. How do you think it made your sister feel? How do you think it made grandma feel? By asking these questions, we start to understand the feelings of others and develop empathy. And that's a powerful thing."

    {
        "questioner": "When nurturing a child's natural inclination towards a certain strength or tendency, should you also encourage them to explore the opposite side and develop other skills? How can this approach help them become well-rounded individuals and maintain balance?",
        "agent": "How did your sister feel? How do you think that made grandma feel? And what are some of the things we could do to make grandma feel good instead of bad? It's important for him to consider people's feelings because it helps him become more aware of them and develop that side of himself. It's crucial to address their weaknesses, especially when it comes to empathy. Occasionally, they need to tap into that emotional side, otherwise, if everything is just an intellectual process, they won't be able to connect with others on an emotional level. Eventually, that ability will fade away because they haven't practiced it. It's better to help them become well-rounded individuals, allowing them to excel in their strengths while maintaining balance. Instead of being solely left-brained or right-brained, we should strive to be whole-brained. Both attributes are important in different situations. Right-brain attributes, like intuition, play a significant role in life. Most of the time, we don't have all the information needed to make logical connections. For instance, when making big decisions like who to marry, it's impossible to have all the necessary information. All the options are possible, and it's unlikely to ever have enough information to make a completely informed choice."

        "agent": "Should I marry Susie or Sally or Rebecca? Well, all of those options are on the table. However, it's important to recognize that gathering enough information to make a purely logical choice may be challenging. This decision holds significant weight as it will shape the course of your entire life. In order to navigate this choice, it's crucial to tap into your intuition and connect with your emotions. By delving into your feelings, you can gain a deeper understanding of which option resonates with you on a more profound level. It's not just about listing attributes and how they align with your own; it's about forging an empathetic and emotional connection. This intuitive aspect plays a vital role in our everyday lives, especially when we lack complete information to make a purely logical decision. Relying solely on guesswork or randomness is not the most reliable approach, as it can be as wrong as it is right. When it comes to a major life decision like choosing a life partner, leaving it up to chance is not ideal. Developing a strong intuitive sense, empathy, and connection with others is crucial. By truly understanding their emotions and seeing them as individuals rather than mere cardboard cutouts, you can bring more depth and meaning to your relationships. It's important to go beyond the surface level and comprehend the reasons behind people's actions and their perspectives."

        "questioner": "When it comes to decision-making, how do you strike a balance between intellectual analysis and intuitive understanding? Can you provide examples of situations where each approach is necessary?",
        "agent": "When you interact with a cardboard cutout, you may not understand why it behaves the way it does or what its purpose is. It's more of an intellectual exercise without a real connection. However, intellectual analysis is still important, especially in certain jobs and aspects of life where critical thinking is crucial. Both intellectual analysis and intuitive understanding are equally important. You need to excel in both because sometimes you need one approach and sometimes you need the other. For example, when searching for your lost glasses, you can use logical reasoning or simply rely on your intuition to visualize their location. Intuitive individuals often find solutions faster than those who rely solely on logical processes. However, relying solely on intuition can lead you astray and into irrational beliefs. It's essential to strike a balance between both approaches. You need the logical analysis to avoid falling into the trap of wishful thinking. So, in conclusion, both intellectual analysis and intuitive understanding are necessary."

        "questioner": "I  remember watching one Ted Talk and there was a lady who had a actually, she wrote a book. It was called stroke of insight. And she had a stroke in I believe it was a left hemisphere. And she woke up or she came to realize a different sense of awareness when the right hemisphere sort of took over. So even though we're talking about a virtual brain here, there are the constraints that the one hemisphere has that it can impose on the consciousness that's coming through versus the other. And the key is to find that balance point, like you're saying yes.",
        "agent": "And  we in the Western world tend to greatly revere the left brain and the logical process. And we don't give a lot of credence to the intuitive part. And probably if you went back, I don't know, 500 years, you'd probably find almost everybody was just the opposite. It was that intuitive part of the brain that was really important because that's what got you by. And that left part good for certain things to help you catch a rabbit, but it wasn't necessarily the part that you lived your life through most of the time. But our technological society is a lot of logical manipulations of things. So that's where the good jobs are and that's where people put high status."

    {
        "questioner": "It's  almost like a pendulum swinging, isn't it, Tom? I mean, we went from this peak in intuition to now we're sort of going into the technological sort of it phase. And now we're trying to find the middle ground. And this is really where MBT kind of, I think speaks volumes, is trying to marry that science and spirituality sort of together and find that sort of balance point.",
        "agent": "Yes, that is true. We need that balance. And I do believe that the pendulum is swinging back. Some individuals are starting to realize that they possess an intuitive side and that this intuitive side can be nurtured and developed. It doesn't have to be something that is unreliable. In fact, it can become a highly reliable aspect of oneself, as long as one understands it and learns to work with it. If you never tap into your intuition and constantly deny its existence, then it won't be a trustworthy tool for you. The same goes for your intellect. If you solely rely on intuition and completely disregard the importance of logical thinking, you won't excel in tasks that require a logical approach. Therefore, we are moving towards a more balanced integration of both intuition and intellect, and I believe that is a positive development. As for whether we will swing back to the other extreme, I don't think so. Our technological advancements and the complexities of our modern lives will always necessitate a certain level of logical thinking. Perhaps not to the same extent as in the past, where computers required extensive knowledge and technical skills to operate, but logical thinking will always be relevant."

        "questioner": "How has technology made our lives easier and helped us achieve a better balance between our left and right brain functions?",
        "agent": "I remember the days when you had to understand how your computer worked, how the operating system worked, and what types of things you could plug into it without causing interference. It was a lot of work back then. But now, you can simply plug it in and it works because the computer system has internal information that helps it connect and resolve problems. Our technology is making things easier for us, taking care of the left brain tasks so that we don't have to rely on them as much. It's possible that our technology will help us achieve a better balance between our left and right brain functions, allowing us to be more well-rounded individuals."

        "questioner": "I  like that. We're going to jump to some questions, Tom, from a few of my listeners. They've sent in a few questions, a question pertaining to reincarnation as it relates to culture. Do we typically choose to reincarnate in the same cultural reality? Maybe to feel a sense of security or even choose the same soul family does jumping from culture to culture with each successive avatar indicative of a IUOC that is more relatively evolved?",
        "agent": "Yes, I agree with both points. As I evolve in the quality of my consciousness, I become more open and capable of embracing differences and facing challenges. I am able to see things from various perspectives and learn from them. That's why I find it valuable to experience different cultures and viewpoints. Although they may seem different, they all ultimately lead to the same destination. By reaching the same destination through multiple paths, I gain a deeper understanding and a stronger grasp of the concept. It's not just about culture, but also about embracing diverse viewpoints in terms of wealth, health, and physical abilities. Having access to these different perspectives is incredibly valuable for personal growth, much like traveling. In the past, many people never traveled far from their homes, which limited their understanding of the world. Those who did travel, even without a specific purpose, were considered more sophisticated and had a broader perspective. They were able to synthesize information at a higher level than those who never ventured beyond their comfort zones. The same principle applies here..."

        "questioner": "How does exposing yourself to different cultures and perspectives contribute to personal growth and understanding? Can you explain the value of immersing oneself in diverse viewpoints and experiences?",
        "agent": "I believe that having a diverse range of experiences is crucial for personal growth and understanding. When we limit ourselves to the same set of experiences, we become comfortable and confident within that narrow scope. However, this limited perspective is local and provincial. To truly comprehend different viewpoints, we must venture out and immerse ourselves in various cultures and perspectives. By doing so, we develop empathy and a deeper understanding of others' struggles, such as poverty or hunger. These experiences broaden our horizons and make us less judgmental, as we can see the world through different lenses. It is valuable to expose ourselves to different cultures and economic backgrounds. Sometimes, we find ourselves in situations where we are caught up in events like wars that have been ongoing for a long time. In such circumstances, our previous knowledge about the negative consequences of war may not immediately come to mind. We may find ourselves swept up in the prevailing culture and mindset. Witnessing others being swept up in violence can be a sobering experience, as it reminds us of the power of cultural influence and the need for critical thinking."

    {
        "questioner": "How has immersing yourself in different cultures and perspectives through travel and exploration shaped your understanding of the world and influenced your ability to empathize with others?",
        "agent": "That's in my culture. And now when I see people getting swept up in violent things, I'm not quite so quick to judge them. I wonder why they do that. Why don't they just say no? Well, there are reasons for that. You can easily get caught up in those kinds of things and appreciate more what's going on in the world. I'm not as quick to say I have all the answers and that others are doing it wrong because I've made mistakes in many places and in many ways. I understand how easy it is to do sometimes. So, traveling has made me more sophisticated. It's given me more viewpoints and a bigger understanding of the world. Yes, I even sometimes jump across virtual realities, which gives me different perspectives on how things work. But for the most part, in the earlier stages of our consciousness evolution, we tend to stick to what we know. It's better to become proficient in something before branching out. It's better to live in your small town until you're in your 30s or 40s before you start traveling. That way, you'll get so much more out of the experience than if you were ten years old. At ten, you'd see a lot of stuff, but it wouldn't really sink in or impress you as much as it would if you were..."

        "agent": "When you're young, it may not seem impressive or rewarding to stick with something and become proficient at it. However, as you get older, you realize the value of investing time and effort into mastering a skill. Once you understand the ins and outs of a particular task or job, it becomes easier to transition into similar roles or industries. While it's true that some aspects of these new experiences may be repetitive, they still contribute to your overall growth. It's in the areas where the differences matter and have a significant impact on your personal development that you truly experience substantial growth."

        "questioner": "So  would you say individuals who have reached that state of enlightenment, whether it be the Christ consciousness, whether it be the Buddha consciousness, they are more likely to jump from one reality to another.",
        "agent": "They have probably already jumped from numerous realities to others by the time they reach that point. They may continue doing so. Once most of the ego and fear are gone, the focus shifts towards finding ways to be of the most help. It also becomes necessary to take refresher courses, to put oneself in stressful and challenging situations. For instance, one might choose to immerse oneself in a culture that is constantly at war, to see how they respond differently from others. There are various actions one can take, especially when it comes to consciousness. Consciousness, like everything else, starts to deteriorate and decay if no effort is put into it. It requires constant maintenance, just like a house. If you neglect your house, it will eventually rot and collapse. The same principle applies to everything. Without effort, everything disintegrates, decomposes, and falls apart. You must always work on evolving and maintaining your consciousness; otherwise, it will start to regress. So, if you think you're done and have achieved..."

    {
        "questioner": "To ensure continuous growth and progress, what actions can you take to maintain and evolve your consciousness? How do these actions serve as refresher courses to assess your abilities and validate your choices?",
        "agent": "Keeping my evolution ongoing is crucial. If I were to simply sit back and think that I've reached my goal, believing that I've made it, and then decide to relax and enjoy myself, I would start to regress. It's important to understand that progress requires continuous effort and dedication. The notion of being like the Buddha and potentially returning to another body to face new challenges may seem unnecessary at first. However, it serves as a way to test ourselves and validate the choices we've made. Is our progress just a stroke of luck, or do we truly possess the qualities needed to consistently move forward? These experiences act as refresher courses, allowing us to assess our abilities and determine if we can consistently make the right choices. Engaging in such activities strengthens our growth, making it more stable and resilient. It's worth noting that evolution can be a delicate process, but it's necessary for our development."

    {
        "questioner": "Robust,  and it acts as a guide, if you will, to the rest of them, as a lighthouse, if you will, to sort of move consciousness down a specific pathway, maybe a little more efficiently. So it can be used by design, would you say?",
        "agent": "Sure, absolutely, by design. Most of the people who have gained a great deal of conscious quality have multiple incarnations that are intentionally chosen. They select incarnations that they believe will provide valuable challenges and opportunities for them to be of service. They consider the specific time, place, people, cultures, and environment of the simulation to determine how they can be most helpful. However, it is possible that despite their intentions, their free will may lead them astray and they may not be as helpful as they initially thought. For example, they may become too focused on overthrowing a dictator and realize that there was more for them to learn from that experience. As a result, they start choosing challenges that align more with their growth and development. There are countless avenues and paths to explore, and an infinite number of aspects to explore within one's personality and consciousness. Therefore, there will always be something new to do and learn. Additionally, if one does not continue to work on their personal growth, entropy increases. In other words, if you don't keep progressing, things start to deteriorate. Therefore, enlightenment is not a destination or an endpoint where you suddenly know everything and are done. It is an ongoing process of growth and evolution. The idea that enlightenment is a final state of knowing everything is merely a wishful thought that does not align with the reality of continuous growth and learning."

    {
        "questioner": "Is it accurate to say that once you achieve enlightenment or knowledge, you have completed your journey and have nothing left to contribute? Can you shed some light on the misconception surrounding the idea of reaching a final state of knowing everything?",
        "agent": "I believe the notion that once you attain enlightenment or knowledge, you are finished and have nothing left to do is simply wishful thinking. It is a misconception that stems from individuals who may have had inflated egos. The truth is, you are never truly done as long as there are others who can benefit from your help. In fact, if you were to reach a point where you consider yourself 'done,' you would actually start to unravel due to the inherent nature of entropy. The idea of achieving enlightenment and then being able to retire from our responsibilities is flawed. As conscious beings, it is our purpose to continually strive to reduce entropy and make a positive impact in the world."

        "questioner": "What  or who determines the data stream that serves me best? Is it computed or is it at some level there is an IUOC or a team of Iuocs that are working with each free will awareness unit?",
        "agent": "It's  some of both. Part of it is you. You have your own ideas. You as an individual unit of consciousness have some idea of what your strengths and weaknesses are. So you have certain things you'd like to do, accomplish, and maybe certain ideas you think that would be good for you to try because from the last time, well, this happened. And now you'd like to see that from the other side. Or you'd like to maybe that was too hard. You'd like to do something a little easier this time. So the individual has a strong input to it, but the individual doesn't know what slots are available, what avatars are available, what their future probability looks like. And for a lot of avatars, future probability is a pretty fuzzy thing. You really don't know, you know, potentials somewhat. So the system has to be involved with that because it's only the system that has that bigger picture, that knows kind of where everything is and what everybody's doing. So the system will pick something out that looks like it has a decent probability of giving you what you need, but there's no guarantee that any of it will work out. It's always a fair amount of randomness in it, but you kind of get something that says, well, this looks like it's got the potential to be what you want."

        "agent": "You know, it's impossible to predict how things will unfold. Sometimes, you may have certain expectations or plans, but life takes a completely different turn. For instance, your parents might unexpectedly fall ill and pass away, leaving you in the care of a less-than-ideal guardian. Suddenly, everything seems to fall apart. These unexpected events can shape you into a different person altogether. Alternatively, you might find yourself facing a life-altering situation, like becoming a quadriplegic, which was never part of your original plan. However, even in the face of such challenges, there is always an opportunity to learn and grow. Every situation, no matter how horrendous, can be a valuable learning experience. If you seize the opportunities that come your way and make the most of them, you will lead a fulfilling life. Whether you are rich or poor, disabled or an accomplished athlete, each incarnation presents its own unique set of challenges. It's not about categorizing some incarnations as good and others as bad based on external circumstances. Instead, it's about recognizing that every experience offers valuable lessons. So, in a way, you have the potential to shape this situation according to your desires. But regardless of the outcome, you will undoubtedly gain wisdom from it. Life presents countless opportunities for growth and learning. And in the grand scheme of things, you are constantly sampling different experiences to evolve and expand your understanding."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "Can you explain how the concept of free will and the unpredictability of life influence the outcome of our experiences and the shaping of our journey?",
        "agent": "I believe that in life, we have countless opportunities to learn and grow. It's like sampling from a vast array of experiences over multiple lifetimes. While most of these experiences may unfold as we hope, some may not. However, we tend to gravitate towards situations that have good potential, increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome. Once we find ourselves in such situations, we simply do what we need to do. The outcome is influenced by the countless variables and possibilities that exist, making it impossible to predict with certainty. This is the nature of reality. Even the most meticulously planned incarnations, where specific events and encounters are orchestrated, are not set in stone. Free will introduces an element of unpredictability, making it unlikely for things to unfold exactly as planned. Instead, they are gently guided or nudged in a certain direction. For instance, you may feel an inexplicable urge to move or visit a particular place, and various signs and encounters may reinforce this feeling. It turns out that the person you were meant to meet is in that very place. These nudges serve as subtle hints or reminders of the plan you made before incarnating. They guide you towards the experiences and connections that are meant to shape your journey."

        "agent": "You know, that's where the other person is. So, what I mean by 'nudged' is that you receive these nudges. Your intuition serves as your connection with the larger conscious system. And this connection operates in both directions. Not only can you receive information through a download, but it also goes the other way. How you feel about things? You can have an intuition that tells you to move to Georgia. It's better there, you'll enjoy the climate. Oh, there's a good job opportunity there. You'll perform better than your current job, which is becoming monotonous. You need something else anyway. You can give it a nudge."

        "agent": "The  IUOC it can. Yes, it can. In other words, you're getting a download of information. That download of information can have multiple sources. It can be something that's put in your data stream just for you to experience. And you may be the only one that experiences that. And you know it was real. No matter how much other people think it's impossible that data was put in your data stream to give you that experience. And if you have some plan that you've made with others in your incarnation or some plan that something you need to accomplish, some particular project you need to push on, then you'll get nudged to be at the right place at the right time to do that. You still have to make the free will choices. When your intuition says, I need to move, I need to go someplace else, I think I ought to go to Georgia, your free will can say, I don't want to go to know, I don't want to go there. It's got this problem and there's too many bugs, too many mosquitoes. I don't want to live in a place like that. I want to live in a desert. Well, you can do that. Well now you just don't meet that person then and that connection doesn't make it. And everybody goes on and does the best they can anyway. You see."

        "questioner": "What's  the key, Tom, distinguishing what's the key to distinguishing and listening to that higher voice?",
        "agent": "Well, the key is that I won't be limited to just two options. First, I won't be following a predetermined script or plan. Instead, I'll be guided by intuitive nudges, which are only accessible to those who have evolved in their consciousness. This is not something that the lower levels of consciousness can do; it's a skill reserved for the higher levels. Secondly, I'll be able to distinguish between accessing data from a database and receiving intuitive guidance. When I ask a question like 'Should I marry Sally?' and receive information about possibilities, probable futures, and interconnections, that's like getting data from a database. But if I suddenly receive a message that suggests I should consider someone completely different, it feels like it's coming from the system itself. It's not something I consciously asked for, but it provides a new perspective that feels external rather than internal."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How do you differentiate between receiving intuitive guidance from an external source and accessing data from a database? Can you explain the process of distinguishing between the two and how it influences your decision-making?",
        "agent": "When I ask for something, it feels like it's coming from outside of me rather than from within. It provides me with a fresh perspective, a new way of looking at things, and encourages me to consider doing something that I might not have thought of otherwise. As I evolve, I am able to distinguish between receiving data and receiving messages from the larger consciousness system. However, if I haven't evolved much, I may question whether I made it up or if it's just my fear talking. In those cases, it's important to step back and examine both possibilities. It can be quite confusing until we reach a point of evolution where it becomes clear. That's why these experiences are more common at higher levels of consciousness with lower entropy. They don't occur as frequently at lower levels because the complexity of fear and ego would make it difficult to navigate. But as we let go of fear and reduce the influence of ego, the clarity of our actions and intentions increases."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "You'Re  doing the subtle nature of it. I mean, it can be really masked with a lot of fear, obviously, so you don't hear it at all. Whereas like you said, someone who's evolved can really distinguish. The signal to noise ratio has really come down where they can really hear that clearly.",
        "agent": "And let me tell you, skepticism is key when it comes to the information you receive. It's crucial to question everything. So, if someone suddenly suggests that you should do something, I wouldn't recommend blindly following their advice. That's a recipe for disaster. Instead, take a step back and evaluate the situation. Ask yourself, why should I do that? What are the potential consequences? Remember, you are in control. Your free will should guide your decisions. It's not about letting voices dictate your actions; that's not a healthy place to be. You need to be the one calling the shots and make choices based on your own desires. Taking responsibility for your decisions is essential. Some individuals, particularly those who rely heavily on their intuition, may fall into the trap of surrendering their free will. They become so dependent on external sources like oracles, stars, guides, or even their own intuition that they can't make a decision without consulting them. They lose their ability to choose and become mere followers. But here's the thing, when you give up your autonomy, you're at the mercy of the system. It might lead you down a path that ends with you taking a plunge into the water. Why? Just to show you the consequences of relying on others to make choices for you. So, remember, it's crucial to maintain your independence and make decisions for yourself, or else you might find yourself in a situation you never wanted to be in."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How important is it to question the information you receive and make decisions based on your own free will? What are the potential consequences of blindly following someone else's advice without evaluating it?",
        "agent": "I want you to know that if you rely on someone else to make decisions for you, you'll end up facing consequences. You'll find yourself in trouble. That's usually what happens. You receive misguided information that you should have been cautious about, but you went along with it because they told you to. So, it's crucial to always question what you receive and consider how it aligns with your life and intuition. If you keep feeling that inner push, and it becomes stronger and stronger, then it starts to feel right. You might start sensing the potential in Georgia, for example. It's starting to feel really promising. However, that's different from blindly following a message and immediately packing your bags to leave. That's not a wise move. You need to reach your own conclusions and make decisions based on your own free will. Never fall into the trap of blindly following directions. Stay skeptical of everything."

    {
        "questioner": "Not  to play the devil's advocate here, but sometimes you think that, well, you want to step into your fear as well, like something that pulls you, but yet you're resistant because it's an uncomfortable place. You want to step into that even though you feel the fear of going into it. Can you speak to that a little bit?",
        "agent": "Sure. That's almost a given. When it comes to getting rid of a fear, it can be quite scary. The process of overcoming fear requires courage. You have to be brave enough to face it head-on, even if it frightens you. It's important to understand that if the fear becomes too overwhelming, it's okay to take a step back and try again later. However, if you're truly committed and genuinely want to conquer your fear, you will find a way to do it. Merely thinking that you should do it won't be enough. It needs to be a deep desire within you. You'll keep pushing yourself and going back to face the fear until you master it and eliminate it completely. So, the key to overcoming fear is reaching a point where you genuinely want to overcome it, rather than just thinking you should. This principle applies to various aspects of life. For instance, if you're addicted to nicotine and smoke cigarettes, quitting will be a challenging journey unless you genuinely want to stop and are fully committed to it. Merely thinking that you should quit because it's better for you, your friends would like you more, or it's healthier won't be enough. It requires a strong determination and genuine desire to succeed."

        "questioner": "When it comes to making a change in your life, how important is it to genuinely want to make that change at a deep level? Can you provide some insights into the process of overcoming fear and how being fully committed plays a role in that?",
        "agent": "When it comes to making a change in your life, like improving your health, it's important to be fully committed. If you're just trying to convince yourself that you should do it without truly wanting to, the process will be much more difficult. This applies to many things, including overcoming fear. The first step is to genuinely want to make the change at a deep level. It's not just about saying 'I want to do it,' but actually taking action and fully immersing yourself in the process. Of course, it's important to be smart about it and start with small steps. For example, if you're afraid of water, start by jumping into shallow water and gradually build your confidence. It's a gradual process, but if you persist even when you're terrified, you'll eventually become a skilled swimmer. However, if you're only doing it because you feel like you should or because others are pressuring you, you'll likely face setbacks and convince yourself that it's not worth it. Your ego will find ways to justify avoiding the challenge. It's crucial to listen to your intuition and assess whether it's the right time and situation for you to take on that particular challenge. Sometimes, it's best to trust your instincts and stay away from certain situations, even if others may not understand."

        "questioner": "A  couple more questions here from listeners and I really want to get to these. One is about time and one is about dreams, first one about time. If the LCS created the rule set to allow this PMR to play itself out, let's go back to the virtual big Bang. How is time different in the LCS versus in the PMR? What I'm asking is, can the larger conscious system jump ahead 13 billion years or so and say, well, here's where the Homo sapiens enter the evolutionary picture, so let's start here. Or does time have to play itself out in the larger consciousness system as well?",
        "agent": "Okay, in general, time has to play itself out because it's a rule set thing. And when something evolves, the future states depend on past states. So as things evolve, you don't suddenly just have a fish leap out of the water and land on the beach as a monkey. It doesn't work like that. It has to first get little legs that drag it along the shore, and then it's a whole series of steps to get there. So you can't jump ahead in something that is evolving, because now, having said that, you can look ahead at the probabilities, what is likely to happen here, but you have to realize there are only probabilities, and that might not happen. But you can look at the probabilities and the potential for things. And if you're the larger consciousness system and let's say you started this simulation at the big digital bang, all right? Now, you've got a couple of billion years before you even get an avatar of any sort. It takes you a couple of billion years to come up with a bacteria, much less something that will serve as a consciousness avatar for conscious to learn. Well, you can always speed up the clock. You can always make your delta t bigger, fatter, so that each delta t now jumps you say a whole second in time rather than ten to the -44 seconds that it does now it maybe jumps you 10 seconds. Or if you got billions of years. Maybe it jumps you a whole day, you see. So your delta t can get big, and particularly when things are mostly random, like when the big digital bang first started."

        "questioner": "During the initial stages of the big digital bang, when matter was expanding and cooling, physicists mention an accelerated phase called inflation. Can you explain how this inflation phase allows for faster progress and skipping over certain details without causing significant issues?",
        "agent": "When things are mostly random, like during the initial stages of the big digital bang, matter was expanding and cooling, and a lot of random events were taking place. During such times, it is possible to accelerate the process without causing significant damage. Physicists refer to this accelerated phase as inflation, where everything seems to move at a much faster pace. This phase is considered less eventful and time-consuming, so it is feasible to make assumptions and skip over certain details without causing any major issues. Since the focus is on significant events rather than intricate processes, it is possible to overlook the finer details and use smaller time intervals (Delta T) to work out the specifics. By doing so, the system can progress rapidly until it reaches a more crucial part of the experiment or simulation."

    {
        "questioner": "In certain situations, it may be necessary to accelerate the progress of an experiment or simulation. Can you explain how you can achieve the desired time resolution by increasing the speed until you reach a more relevant part and then gradually decreasing the speed?",

    },
    {
        "questioner": "So  is this time resolution equal to the time resolution that's in the larger constant system?",
        "agent": "No, not at all. In every virtual reality, we can establish our own clock. You see, our virtual reality operates with both spatial and temporal resolutions. All simulations follow this pattern. If it's a dynamic simulation, that means things change over time. The process works by calculating the current state, incrementing time slightly, and recalculating the changes. Let's take motion as an example. Initially, an object is located here, and after a small time increment, it moves to a new position. With each subsequent time increment, it progresses further. Therefore, events unfold as time progresses. The choice of the time increment, Delta T, is entirely up to the creators of the simulation. They decide what value of Delta T is appropriate. If Delta T is too small, the simulation has high resolution, but it requires significant computational power. For instance, it may take 10 million Delta T's to move an object by just an inch. This results in a substantial amount of data to process. On the other hand, if Delta T is set to once every second, the object can move more quickly, but the motion becomes jerky and less smooth. In such cases, higher resolution is desired. As the level of detail and dependence on specific characteristics of the objects increase, a smaller Delta T is necessary. The same principle applies to the spatial resolution, represented by Delta X, Delta Y, and Delta Z in our three-dimensional reality."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "When setting up a simulation, what are some important factors to consider in order to achieve higher resolution in both space and time?",
        "agent": "In a three-dimensional reality like ours, we refer to X, Y, and Z as a little delta volume. By increasing the size of this delta volume, each unit of time becomes a larger step. For example, if we make the smallest amount you can move in each step a foot, then the next Delta T would require you to move at least a foot because that's the pixel size. However, this larger step size poses limitations. For instance, you wouldn't be able to bend over and pick up a pin from the ground if you move in such large increments. To overcome this, you would need higher resolution in both space and time. This means having a smaller space and a smaller time interval, which allows for more detailed simulations. For instance, scientists using atom smashers require a high level of resolution to obtain accurate results. Without this resolution, the results would fall between pixels, leaving gaps in the data. When setting up a simulation, it's important to consider factors such as memory usage, processing power, data throughput, and the refresh rate (Delta T). Additionally, the number of calculations required between each Delta T is also a crucial consideration."

    {
        "questioner": "When setting up a simulation, what are some factors to consider in order to optimize the refreshing process and reduce the number of calculations required between each Delta T?",
        "agent": "To avoid the need for constant refreshing, I often wonder how frequently I should refresh it. This refreshing process is known as Delta T. Additionally, I often contemplate the number of calculations required between each Delta T. It seems that using larger Delta T's and Delta X's could potentially reduce the number of calculations needed."

    {
        "questioner": "What  is Delta T in the LCS then?",
        "agent": "Well, you see, the smallest unit of time in the whole system is what we call a tick. As this conscious system evolved, it developed regular time. Of course, it always had a primordial time, because without it, it wouldn't have been able to evolve into a system with regular time. But as it continued to evolve, it realized that having regular time allowed it to sequence things. So, it implemented a digital system where a state would flip between one and zero, like a metronome with the pattern 101010. The speed at which this state could flip became the fastest time in the system. Everything else had to operate at that speed or slower. In my simulation, for every 100,000 ticks of the LCS's clock, I only tick once in my virtual reality. You see, in computer programs, we have clock time in the computer room, which is the larger conscious system, and then we have simulation time. They're not the same thing. The clock time in the computer room represents the fastest speed we can achieve. However, the Delta T for this virtual reality can be much slower than that, as long as it's fast enough for the simulation to be good enough for avatars to perform their tasks. And that's..."

    {
        "questioner": "In the context of virtual reality simulations, what is the significance of maintaining a smooth and realistic experience, and how does the speed limit of one pixel per delta T contribute to achieving this goal?",
        "agent": "It is important to ensure that the simulation is of sufficient quality for avatars to perform their tasks effectively. The system's ability to modify the simulation in real-time imposes a speed limit on the movement within the simulation. This means that each pixel can only be moved within a specific time interval, known as delta T. If the movement exceeds this limit, the simulation becomes jumpy and discontinuous, resulting in a less smooth experience. To maintain a smooth and realistic simulation, it is crucial to adhere to the speed limit of one pixel per delta T. In our virtual reality, this speed limit is equivalent to the speed of light. Every virtual reality system, as long as it is coherent and aims to replicate physical-like interactions, should strive for smoothness. A jumpy system distorts the environment, making it challenging to predict and plan interactions. Consequently, learning becomes more random and difficult. Each virtual reality system will have its own unique speed limit, determined by its nature. The larger consciousness system serves as the master clock, overseeing the coordination of these speed limits."
    },
    {
        "questioner": "How does the larger consciousness system determine the speed at which each virtual reality runs, and why is it important for each virtual reality to have its own unique delta T?",
        "agent": "Well, what happens is that the larger consciousness system, which is responsible for running all the virtual realities, has a master clock. This master clock determines the speed at which everything else runs in each virtual reality. However, the master clock speed doesn't have to be the same for all virtual realities. Each virtual reality can have its own delta T, which is the time interval between each tick of the clock, based on its specific needs. This allows for efficient use of computer resources, as you don't want to allocate the highest speed and resolution to all virtual realities if they don't require it. For example, if we were to set our resolution to ten to the minus 50th seconds and calculate every change in the simulation at that level of detail, it would be an enormous amount of work. However, if we increase the delta T to ten to the minus 44 seconds, which is six orders of magnitude slower, we significantly reduce the computational workload by six orders of magnitude. This optimization ensures that each virtual reality operates at the necessary level of detail without wasting resources."

    {
        "questioner": "How does the adjustment of delta T and delta X in the simulation help maintain the speed limit and ensure that the ratio of delta X to delta T remains constant?",
        "agent": "Well, when we delve into smaller and smaller things, the resolution of the simulation starts to become strained. However, we still want to maintain the ratio of delta X to delta T, which defines the speed of light. In this case, delta X represents distance and delta T represents time. The speed limit, denoted as C, is the ratio of delta X to delta T. Now, we can keep this ratio constant by adjusting delta T and delta X accordingly. For example, if we decrease delta T by half and decrease delta X by half as well, the new ratio of delta X to delta T remains the same, and thus the speed limit remains unchanged. However, we can't simply divide delta X by half because we are working in digital space, where we can only deal with whole pixels. We can't have fractions of pixels. So, if we were to divide delta X by two, we would end up with a fraction of a pixel, which is not feasible. Therefore, we have to round it to the nearest whole pixel. For instance, if the result is 162.5 pixels, we would round it to either 162 or 163 pixels, not 162.3 pixels. Dividing delta X and delta T alone won't give us the exact same ratio anymore, but it will be close since the pixels are small. However, it won't be a precise match. This is the challenge that physicists are currently facing..."

    {
        "questioner": "Why is it important for physicists to achieve higher resolution in order to detect subtle variations in the value of C, and how does this relate to optimizing the speed limit while considering future needs?",
        "agent": "Pixels are small, but it's challenging to achieve precise outcomes. That's what physicists observe. Occasionally, they notice slight changes in the value of C, although it's only in the fifth or sixth decimal place, or even the tenth, considering the limitations of our pixel technology. These changes have puzzled scientists for a long time. As they delved deeper into the details, they realized that higher resolution was necessary to detect these subtle variations. With increased resolution, we can now measure changes in the fifth or sixth decimal place. In fact, we can even measure it up to eight decimal places. This confirms that the changes are indeed real. The system prefers to maintain a consistent speed limit because it significantly influences the functioning of this reality. However, it also wants to optimize the resolution to meet our foreseeable needs in the next century. We don't need to make adjustments every week, but we can shift it to accommodate what we anticipate requiring in the future."

        "agent": "Yeah,  that's a perception of time. And perception of time is very relative to what's going on around you. And if you go into a cave and it's dark and nothing changes, it's just black. And you sit in that cave, pretty soon you don't know whether you've been in there a week or six weeks or a month. Unless you have some way of putting piling stones or making marks on the wall or some way to do that, there's nothing to judge, you see? So if you just sit in a black hole yeah, time goes away. You have no sense of time. I've been here a day, I've been here a year. Who knows? Because your sense of time disappears. It's very relative to other things. So when you to your environment so."

    {
        "questioner": "You'Re  not necessarily going into a different.",
        "agent": "Yeah, that's a different sort of thing. Now, this is just my perception. I perceive time in terms of change. Things change. The Earth revolves once, so the sun comes up, the sun goes down. These are changes. And I then make time in terms of these changes. That's how I perceive it. So if I put myself in an environment that doesn't change, that's what time becomes. Time is change. Change requires time. Without any change, there's no need for time. I lose track of it. I have no perception of it anymore. So when I get into an altered state, my time sense will change because what I'm doing seems to go by differently. My mind, my consciousness, can process very quickly. In a matter of two or three minutes of clock time here in this virtual reality, the clock on my bedside table, two or three minutes can go by, and I've done a week's worth of work in a virtual reality someplace. I've gotten up, I've gone to bed, I've done things. Because my consciousness can process very quickly, I can often get a lot done. That doesn't take very long in the time here. And it can be the opposite as well. I can go into spaces where things aren't happening that much. Maybe I'm just sitting in that void space, just relaxing, floating in the void, sort of like getting in my hot tub on a dark, starry night. I just sit there and I'm not really processing anything. And I can do that for a while, just enjoying the stillness and tranquility."

Surprisingly, I can spend quite some time in this state, only to realize that an hour and a half has passed. It's almost like a meditation session, where I'm not engaged in any specific activity. Instead, I'm just present in this blank space, detached from the concept of time. Time seems to lose its grip on me, as I don't have a relative measure of its passing. Our perception of time is closely tied to the changes we observe. When there are no noticeable changes, it feels as though time has stood still."

    {
        "questioner": "Good,  great. Thank you for that last question. I want to get to this because this is about intent and focus and using the dream state oh yes, novelism, novelism and the ancient toltec practice of using dreams as a way to plant a seed of intent and manifestation. And my question is, aside from using dream states to plant a seed, which may seem as a passive exercise, how can we use dreams to actively train and strengthen our ability to hold focus and intent in our waking state?",
        "agent": "Well, it will go either way. You see, in both cases it's the same consciousness. Whether you're a dream or awake, it's the same consciousness and it's just plain in two different data streams. The dream is another data stream and it has its own rule set. It's another virtual reality. You get to make choices there and evolve and devolve according to those choices. And then you get in this virtual reality that we call our physical universe, you get to make choices and you evolve or dive according to choices. There's nothing really fundamentally different about either state. There's just two different virtual realities. And because it's one consciousness, you can work that both ways. You can hear, say, a lot of people who don't remember dreams, they can start having intent, I want to remember my dreams, I want to remember my dreams. Or people who want to get lucid dreams, they'll go to bed with an intent, I want to wake up, they kind of program the intent. Or even people who want to wake up at 06:00 in the morning and there's no alarm clock. You can program your mind I want to wake up at six, I need to wake up at six. And if you program that with enough intent, you'll wake up at 06:00, your eyes will pop open or you'll get your lucid dream, or you'll start remembering your dreams. So you can program in this reality and have it affect the dream reality and your sleep and you can do it vice versa. In a dream reality, you can focus your intent and have things happen differently in your dream."

        "questioner": "How can we harness the power of our consciousness in both dream and waking states to manifest our intentions and influence the outcomes in all realities?",
        "agent": "When we shift our focus and intent in a dream reality, we can influence the outcomes in this reality because it is the same consciousness at play. It's like programming, where we repeatedly emphasize a specific thing, imprinting it into our consciousness. This consciousness exists in both virtual and physical realities. So, no matter which reality we choose to manifest our intentions, it will have an impact on all realities. Whether we are in an out-of-body experience, a lucid dream, or even in our waking reality, it is all part of the same consciousness. By changing the focus of our consciousness, we can bring about changes that will be reflected in all the realities we experience."

Can you practice your I think that's what the question was sort of pointing to was can you strengthen your ability to focus your intent in that altered state a little bit easier versus this state?",
        "agent": "Well, kind of yes and no. I mean, you get results back. You get encouragement much better when you're not in a non-physical state, whether it's a dream or an out-of-body experience. An out-of-body experience is similar to a dream, except you never lose consciousness. It's a continuous state of awareness. In other reality frames with less restrictive rule sets, you can experience instant results and quickly manifest things. For example, if you're in an out-of-body state, you can simply think, 'I'd really love to taste a cherry vanilla ice cream cone,' and poof, it appears in your hand. You can lick it and it will taste delicious, the best ice cream cone you've ever had. Manifestation happens that quickly in those realities. However, in this physical reality, it doesn't work like that. It's a lot harder here because we have a rule set to abide by. Things have to happen according to a set of rules. In the non-physical space, doing your exercises will give you feedback and encouragement, which is lacking here. Trying to make an ice cream cone appear in your hand in this physical reality just never happens. And when it never happens, you give up and move on. But in the non-physical space, where manifestation is possible, it gives you encouragement to continue practicing and working at it. So, yes, the exercises you do anywhere will help your consciousness perform those same actions every time."

        "questioner": "In what ways can you use your intent and consciousness to affect things in this physical reality, regardless of whether you're in a dream state, out-of-body experience, or meditation state?",
        "agent": "And yes, the things I work at anywhere will help my consciousness do those same things every place else. It's my consciousness that I'm working on. I'm the same consciousness no matter what reality frame I'm in. Now, I can use my mind. I thought this is where I was going in the beginning, that I could use my intent in a dream state or in an out of body state or just in a meditation state in order to impart information here to affect things here. Let's just call it a meditation state. Whether it's dream or out of body or whatever, it doesn't matter. But when I get in a meditation state, I'm not in this physical reality anymore. I've let go of it. I'm at point consciousness. I can use that intent to communicate with people who are here, and they will get the communication. Now, they may or may not accept it, and if I say things that are annoying, they may turn it off or whatever, but I can connect with people and I can set intents for things to happen here just like I can anyplace else. So I can set an intent that next week when we have the big picnic, it's going to be sunny. You see, that's an intent. And whether I do that from the dream reality or do that from this reality doesn't make any difference. An intention and an intention, my consciousness is in the conscious system. My intention modifies future probability of whatever system I'm talking about. Or if I'm in this system, I can intend things that would affect..."

        "agent": "When we talk about any system, whether it's the dream reality or the physical reality, our intentions can have an impact. It's a simple concept, really. Since we are all part of the same consciousness, our intentions can manifest anywhere. As long as our consciousness is affected, we experience those effects wherever we go. For example, practicing a speech in a daydream can actually improve our performance in the physical reality. Many people who are not comfortable speaking in front of a large audience spend time visualizing themselves delivering the speech flawlessly. They imagine walking up to the stage, using visual aids, and speaking confidently. They even imagine the presence of an audience, which helps them deliver the speech smoothly. This daydreaming process takes them to another reality frame, temporarily letting go of the physical one."

        "questioner": "How can exploring other reality frames, such as daydreaming or indulging in a meditative state, positively impact various aspects of our lives and enhance our skills in both the physical and dream realities?",
        "agent": "In my experience, exploring other reality frames can be quite beneficial. Whether it's letting go of the physical reality or indulging in daydreams, these practices can help improve various aspects of our lives. For instance, rehearsing a speech in a daydream reality can significantly enhance our public speaking skills. By repeating the process multiple times, we become more comfortable and confident, making the actual speech much easier. The beauty of these practices is that they teach consciousness and allow us to change our perspective within the realm of consciousness itself. Once our perspective is altered, it positively impacts all areas of our lives. So, giving better speeches in dreams becomes possible because we have already honed our skills in the physical world, and vice versa. The dream reality offers even more possibilities as there are fewer restrictions, enabling us to do things and interact with people in ways that may not be feasible in the physical world. However, the daydream reality can be just as effective if we can immerse ourselves in it fully. For example, entering a meditative state and visualizing ourselves giving a speech to an audience of a hundred people can be incredibly powerful. In that moment, we are no longer bound by this reality; instead, we are fully present in the daydream reality, delivering a compelling speech. This approach can be more impactful than simply sitting in our room..."

        "agent": "Absolutely. As a multidimensional being, I believe that there are countless data streams that we can connect to and generate data from. Unfortunately, we often limit ourselves to this singular reality, dismissing the potential of other dimensions. It's truly a shame because we have the capacity to function in various reality frames simultaneously, rather than sequentially. We can engage with multiple realities at once, just like children do when they have an imaginary friend. They don't detach from this reality; instead, they incorporate their invisible friend into their physical play. This is an example of parallel processing, where two realities coexist effortlessly. With a little practice, anyone can achieve this level of parallel processing. It's not as challenging as it may seem. However, many people fail to recognize that these other realities are not mere fabrications of our imagination. They are valid and impactful dimensions that shape our experiences.

Whether we daydream about something we desire or actually act upon it in this physical reality or in a dream, we are still making choices that shape our journey. The quality of our choices determines the outcome, regardless of the reality we find ourselves in. Each reality may have different rules, possibilities, feedback, and consequences. For instance, in a dream reality, there may be no lasting consequences as everything fades away when we wake up. However, it doesn't mean that dream choices are insignificant. They are still choices made by our consciousness and hold equal weight to any other choice we make. Consciousness is constantly receiving a data stream, and it is through this stream that we make our choices."

And people like you give me an opportunity to interact with other people, new audiences, new places, with new questions. And I always say things, even if I am going over similar material, I say it in different ways. And getting it has a lot to do with the way you say it. You say it this way, and some people get it and some people don't. And then you say it a different way, and the different people will get it and others don't. So to say it ten different ways is not just redundant. It really is helpful to people to hear things in a different context and in a different way. And one, they'll say, I get it, it clicks. And all the rest of them, they maybe heard it 100 times, but it never clicked for them until they heard it that time in that way. So I don't have a problem with redundancy. I think redundancy is necessary and it's just the way people learn. When you're talking to 100,000 people all at once, you're going to have to do a lot of redundancy because you have to answer each one. And even in a talk I'll answer a question one way and that same question will be asked three more times before I'm done.
