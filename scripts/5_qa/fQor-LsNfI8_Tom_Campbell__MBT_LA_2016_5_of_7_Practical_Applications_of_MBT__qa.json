        "agent": "Thank you. Today is going to be a more relaxed and easier day. We won't be bombarding you with scientific information all day. Instead, I will be talking and we won't even need the slides because it's going to be a conversation. Diagrams and pictures won't be necessary. But let's recall the very first slide where I mentioned that we discussed science yesterday, and today we will focus on why you should care. What does this have to do with you? Multiverse-based Theory (MBT) has two distinct aspects. Yesterday, we delved into the scientific aspect of MBT, which, as a scientist, I find important. It serves as a lever to make the rest of MBT more widely known, utilized, and ultimately more helpful. However, the real essence of MBT lies in its message, which is far more significant than the scientific aspect. If we examine the content of the message, it resides in the softer side of MBT, not in the realm of science. When I wrote my books, they were not intended to be scientific textbooks. And when you read them, you'll find that they are not. They are about consciousness, personal growth, and individual evolution. These topics are fundamental to MBT, even more so than the science itself. While science holds its own importance, it is not the most significant aspect. What truly matters is how MBT can help you. It has the potential to..."

        "questioner": "How does MBT go beyond the intellectual understanding and offer practical applications that can benefit individuals on a personal level?",
        "agent": "What I find most significant is not just the intellectual understanding of MBT, but rather its practical application and how it can benefit you personally. The key to getting something useful out of MBT lies in your own personal connection to the information. While the science behind it may be intellectual, the real importance lies at the core of your being. This is where all the significant things happen, not in the realm of the mind. In fact, relying too much on the mind can often lead to confusion and make it difficult to connect with your true self. Our culture tends to prioritize living in our heads, making decisions, choices, and relationships based on rational thinking. We constantly try to figure everything out in order to optimize our experience and shape our world according to our ego and fears. However, this is not the path we truly desire. Today, we will focus on the softer side of MBT and engage in a Q&A session. I believe that answering your questions is more significant than simply lecturing to you. So, let's dive into the discussion and explore the practical aspects of MBT."

        "agent": "I find your questions to be of greater significance than simply standing up here and lecturing to you. While I could talk about the same topics that have been covered in numerous lectures and books, it is much more valuable to address the specific inquiries that are on your mind. This discussion will reach a wide audience, potentially tens of thousands of people, and it is highly likely that many of them share similar questions and concerns. By answering your question, I can provide insights and guidance to not only you but also to the thousands of others who are facing similar challenges. Our shared cultural backgrounds and worldviews mean that we often encounter the same issues and uncertainties. Therefore, your questions hold immense value and take precedence over my lecturing. Let's focus on addressing your specific queries and the areas where you feel stuck or unsure about how to proceed. But before we delve into that, let's move on from the soft..."

        "agent": "Well, let's dive into the soft side of things and explore what MBT (My Big Toe) has to offer you. Why should you care about this? There are numerous reasons why it's important. Firstly, MBT can help you find direction and purpose in life. It can answer those existential questions that often leave us feeling lost and unsure. Questions like, 'What am I supposed to be doing?' and 'What's the point of my existence?' By understanding MBT, you'll realize that your mission is to grow and evolve, to lower your entropy, and ultimately, to become love. Embracing this mission brings fulfillment and happiness, while ignoring it leads to a difficult and painful existence. It's like the carrot and the stick analogy. If you work on yourself and align with your mission, life will become more interesting, exciting, and joyful. However, if you neglect your growth, life will become increasingly challenging and filled with unhappiness. So, it's crucial to recognize your purpose and actively work towards it. Now, you might be wondering how this reality works and how you can interact with it to grow. You might be seeking a strategy or a prescription for personal development. While it's not as simple as a few words, I can tell you that living from your authentic self, your being level, is a good starting point. By being true to yourself and exploring your innermost desires, you'll naturally align with your mission and experience personal growth. It's a journey of self-discovery and self-actualization. So, embrace MBT and embark on this transformative path of becoming."

        "agent": "I could just tell you to live authentically and find meaning in every experience. That's the essence of it. However, I understand that this advice may seem vague and unhelpful to many. So, let's delve into more specific actions and approaches to achieve our goals. It's important to recognize that we, as conscious beings, collectively shape the reality we inhabit. It may be disheartening to realize that our reality reflects our flaws, such as cruelty, greed, and abuse. But this realization also empowers us because if we created it, we can improve it. We have the ability to make our reality better. Now, how do we go about making it better? Many of us would like to address the negative aspects directly. For instance, we might want to remove an arrogant person from a position of power..."

        "questioner": "What is the root cause of the negative aspects in our reality that we need to address in order to make lasting improvements?",
        "agent": "Well, let me tell you, there are some things that we know are bad. And I have to say, this person I'm talking about, they are a real arrogant individual. In my opinion, they shouldn't hold any position of power, especially not as the head of that corporation. They just rip people off left and right. But you know what? If we had the power to change things, to manipulate the world and make it a kinder, gentler place, everything would definitely improve. However, here's the catch: it wouldn't last in the long run. Why, you ask? Because we, as individuals, would still be the same. We create this reality, and no matter who you put in charge, no matter how kind, loving, and generous they are, eventually things would go back to the way they were. It's like a cycle that keeps repeating itself. So, manipulating the world to make it better is not the answer. It's merely addressing the symptoms. You see, the symptoms are that people are mean-spirited, they lack cooperation, and they only care about themselves. We witness these symptoms all around us, but we fail to pay attention to the root cause. And guess what? The root cause is inside each and every one of us. It's who we are at our core. So, if we want to truly change the world, save the world, it's not a matter of manipulating it to fit our ideals. It doesn't work that way..."

        "questioner": "What is the key to making a real difference in the world and creating lasting improvements? How can personal growth and self-improvement contribute to positive change?",
        "agent": "The key to making a real difference in the world is not by manipulating external circumstances, but by focusing on personal growth and self-improvement. We have the power to change ourselves, and that power should not be underestimated. When we let go of fear and ego, it has a positive impact on the people around us. Our consciousness is interconnected, and when we radiate fearlessness, it uplifts others. Just as being around negative and miserable people can bring us down, being around those who have grown and overcome their fears can inspire us to rise higher. If enough of us choose to uplift instead of dragging others down, we can create a significant change. The first step is recognizing that our purpose is to evolve and grow. This realization gives us the motivation to strive for personal development. The second step is taking responsibility for ourselves and understanding that we don't need to change others. By focusing on changing ourselves at a fundamental level, we can improve our own lives and indirectly influence those around us."

        "questioner": "When striving for personal growth and self-improvement, what is the key factor to focus on in order to achieve a fundamental transformation at the being level?",
        "agent": "When you want to improve yourself, it's essential to focus on changing at the being level rather than just acquiring intellectual knowledge. Reading books and gaining information alone won't truly help you grow. It's not enough to talk the talk or sound knowledgeable; you need to walk the talk and embody the change. Our goal is to transform ourselves at the core, which goes beyond mere thoughts. This transformation is significant because it means becoming a different person altogether. So, how do we achieve this change at the being level? The key lies in addressing our fears. To become a being of love, we must let go of fear and ego. By eliminating fear, we naturally embody love. It's not about acquiring something external; it's about releasing what's already within us. In a way, this should make the process easier because we already possess all the necessary tools."

        "questioner": "In order to achieve a fundamental transformation at the being level, what is the key factor to focus on and how does it relate to addressing our fears and letting go of our ego and beliefs?",
        "agent": "To change ourselves at the being level, we need to address our fears and let go of our ego and beliefs. Beliefs act as barriers, limiting the information we can process and the thoughts we can entertain. They create a box that confines us. By shedding these beliefs, we can expand our perspective and see bigger pictures. Love, on the other hand, is about others and is unconditional. If love comes with conditions, it is not truly love. Love is the essence of a low entropy consciousness."

    {
        "questioner": "How does love relate to our consciousness and the concept of low entropy? Can you explain the connection between love, caring for others, and expanding our perspective?",
        "agent": "Well, what is love? Love, to me, is the essence of a consciousness with low entropy. It is about caring for others, not just oneself. Some may argue that love should be self-centered, as we are the main actors in our own lives. They believe that if we don't prioritize ourselves, no one else will. They argue that our own perspective and vision are crucial. But this is a misconception. Ego is not about self-importance; it is about awareness. We are all aware beings, conscious of our existence. Ego, however, becomes problematic when it serves fear. This is the same understanding of ego that Freud discussed. He recognized that ego is a normal and healthy part of every individual, our sense of self. However, he failed to grasp that excessive self-concern and self-interest can lead to a distorted ego. He gathered data from his conversations with people, analyzing and studying their experiences. He discovered that an excessive focus on oneself can be detrimental..."

        "questioner": "How does having a sense of self and acknowledging the 'I' contribute to our ability to be helpful and useful to others? Can you explain the relationship between self-concept, responsibilities, and serving love rather than ego?",
        "agent": "I found through observation that most people have a high level of self-concern and self-interest. It seems like everyone is focused on themselves, and yet they appear to be healthy, getting along, and contributing to society. This made me think that having an ego is normal and even beneficial. However, what I failed to realize is that this ego is often a result of fear. While it may be average or normal, it is not necessarily healthy. We need to let go of this ego. On the other hand, when awareness is driven by love, it is not ego-driven. This means that having a self-concept is not inherently bad. In fact, it is necessary. But this self-concept should be developed in service of love, which is different from ego. We do need a sense of self because it helps us understand how we can be of assistance to others. We have responsibilities towards our families, financial obligations, and daily tasks to fulfill. Being aware of ourselves and our responsibilities allows us to be helpful and useful to others. So, acknowledging the 'I' is important, but it should be done in a way that serves love and not ego."

    {
        "questioner": "How can acknowledging your sense of self and understanding your responsibilities contribute to your ability to be helpful and useful to others? Can you explain the relationship between self-concept, responsibilities, and serving love rather than ego?",
        "agent": "Well, let me explain how I can be of use and what I can do for others. I believe that I am an individual unit of consciousness, and my purpose is to be of service and provide assistance. This sense of self is driven by a desire to be helpful and make a positive impact. However, it is important to note that this desire is rooted in love, not in selfishness. It is not about what I need or want for myself, such as appreciation or care. That is a different aspect altogether. The fear that arises within us is the fear of not having our needs met, the fear of inadequacy, the fear of rejection, and various other fears like abandonment and failure. These fears are what drive our desires and needs. We may feel the need for material possessions, like a new Mercedes Benz, or the need for status and importance, or even the need for our children's respect. All these needs are rooted in our fears. We fear that we don't deserve status, or that our children won't like us. These fears are on the other side of our desires. So, what I'm trying to convey is that the ego is the awareness that operates in service of fear. On the other hand, the true essence of who we are, our being level, operates in service of love. This is the authentic self. Now, if we want to eliminate the ego, we must first address and overcome our fears. Once we are able to let go of our fears, the ego will naturally dissolve because it is no longer fueled by fear. So, the key is to work on releasing our fears in order to transcend the ego."

    {
        "questioner": "How does the dissolution of fear contribute to the fading away of beliefs and the ego? Can you explain the relationship between fear, beliefs, and the ego, and how releasing fear can help us address these aspects of ourselves?",
        "agent": "When we let go of fear, the ego dissipates as well. Without fear, there is no longer a need for the ego to protect us. This is why our beliefs also start to fade away. Our beliefs often stem from a dislike of uncertainty, which in turn triggers fear. We fear that things may not go as we want or expect, and this feeling of powerlessness drives us to create beliefs that provide a sense of security. Whenever we encounter information that contradicts our existing beliefs, we simply form new ones to shield ourselves from the discomfort of uncertainty. These beliefs act as a shield for our ignorance. Instead of acknowledging what we don't know, we fill the void with beliefs that make us feel knowledgeable. I refer to this as 'pseudo knowledge' in my book. Both our beliefs and our ego, with the ego being more apparent, are the root of the problem. To truly address this, we must confront and release our fear. However, finding the fear can be challenging because the ego's purpose is to keep it hidden from our conscious awareness. The ego employs various strategies to bury the fear deep within us, allowing us to ignore its existence."

        "questioner": "What are some common strategies that people employ to cope with fear, and how do these strategies hinder personal growth and progress?",
        "agent": "I believe that fear is something we often try to avoid or downplay. We pretend it doesn't exist or that it doesn't affect us. We develop various strategies to cope with our fears, which can be quite diverse. For instance, if we feel insecure or inadequate, we might adopt a strategy of being loud and arrogant to compensate for our feelings of inadequacy. On the other hand, we might choose to withdraw and hide, becoming a wallflower. These are extreme examples, but they are both strategies for dealing with fear. There are countless other strategies people employ as well. One common strategy is to avoid participating in activities where we might fail. Many people adopt the mindset of 'if I don't play, I can't lose.' They convince themselves that they don't care or aren't interested in certain things to protect themselves from potential disappointment or failure. However, the truth is that if you don't play, you can't win. You can't grow or make progress. In fact, by not moving forward, you're likely to move backward. So, in essence, this strategy is a losing one..."

        "questioner": "How do our fears often manifest in our behavior and what are some common strategies we employ to cope with them? How do these strategies hinder personal growth and progress?",
        "agent": "Anywhere. And if I can't move forward, what I will do is move backward. So that's a losing strategy. It's not even a hold your own strategy. That's a losing strategy. But I use that strategy for all sorts of things. If I think about it, I probably find that I use that strategy on a lot of things. I'm not aware of my fears. They hide because I hide them with my ego. But my ego, that's really easy to see. That's there right on the surface, where I can grab hold of it and look at it. And my beliefs are also hard to see. I don't know what I believe. I have no idea because these aren't beliefs that I sat down and memorized and learned. They're beliefs that just got into me by osmosis, by convenience, by making me feel better. So they're not something I intellectually did. It just happens to me and I take them on. Beliefs are hard, but the ego is easy. How do I find ego? I just look at my feelings. I look at my emotions. If I feel unhappy, if I feel angry, if I feel upset, if I feel anxious, all of the things that I see as negatives, if I feel irritated, that's because of ego. I can take that feeling and I can trace that feeling back to a fear. Why am I angry? Well, I'm angry because she said this and that and that's just not fair. So I'm angry. Well, what's the fear behind that? No, I'm not angry because of what she said. I choose to be angry because of what she said. Number one, I take responsibility for how I feel. Nobody makes me an..."

        "agent": "I was angry because of what she said. Number one, I need to take responsibility for how I feel. Nobody makes me angry. I choose to be angry. Nobody makes me upset. Nobody makes me anxious. Nobody irritates me. I choose those things in reaction to something else. But it's my choice. I don't have to be angry. I can choose to be different. So step one, in this process of pinpointing my fear, is to take responsibility for my feelings. And if my feelings are negative, if my feelings aren't positive, if my life isn't a life of joy and satisfaction, then I've got fear. Because when I get rid of the fear, my life will be joy and satisfaction primarily. That'll be my life. It'll be great, it'll be fun, and every day will just be better than the next. And I'll have a lot of joy in my life. And if that's not the way I feel now, then I have fear. Well, I need to look at those times that I feel negative. I need to look at the times I feel upset. Why am I upset? I am upset because I wasn't appreciated. Somebody said something that was rude to me. All right, well, what's the fear there? The fear there is, well, if I wasn't appreciated, the fear is of not being appreciated, but the deeper fear is of not being loved, not being thought well of, of not being thought to be important or significant or it's that sort of stuff. In other words, it goes back to a fear of failure, a fear of inadequacy. These are fears that most of us have. So I need to find that negative feeling and probe deeper into it."

It's rare to come across someone who can confidently say that their life is filled with nothing but joy and satisfaction. I'm sure many of you can relate to experiencing negative emotions in the past week, or even in the last hour. It's almost a constant battle, especially during the workday, where negative feelings can arise within minutes. Whenever we encounter something that causes us distress, we tend to shift the blame onto others. We say things like, 'They make me feel angry' or 'Why don't they see things the way I do?' This behavior stems from our ego, and it's something we engage in on a daily basis. Consequently, we allow our fears to dictate our choices, interactions, and relationships. This constant struggle is the reason why we lack peace, joy, happiness, and satisfaction in our lives. We need to recognize that it's our own choices that need to change. We must consciously choose happiness and make better decisions. This is where MBT comes into play..."

It affects all aspects of my life, determining the quality of my life and my relationships. Relationships are where I truly experience the impact of my choices. They are up close and personal, providing ample opportunities for growth and learning. It's not just romantic relationships that matter, but also the relationships with my children, parents, boss, and coworkers. All these relationships contribute to the negative feelings we experience. It's not the trees or rocks that make us angry, but other people. That's why our focus should be on making choices that promote love and connection.

How can I persuade my boss to grant me a promotion? How can I attain my desires? How can I guide my children towards successful careers instead of them falling into destructive habits? How can I exert control over the world to shape it in my image? These thoughts are driven by ego. Admittedly, some level of control is necessary to meet our practical needs, such as paying the mortgage. However, we often go beyond that and seek to control everything. In fact, a significant portion of our energy, around 95%, is dedicated to controlling others and the external world. This preoccupation with control prevents us from fully experiencing the present moment. Instead, we constantly dwell on how to orchestrate outcomes in our favor. How can we ensure our needs are met? How can we mold people to conform to our desires? How can we manipulate our boss's thoughts? How can we shape our children's thinking?

This is particularly true with adults, even young adults. It's crucial to allow them the freedom to be themselves. To better understand and address our ego, one simple step we can take is to let go of the need for control. We should stop constantly trying to control every aspect of our lives. This means stepping out of our heads and not obsessively trying to figure everything out in order to manipulate situations to our advantage. It's important to realize that this approach should not dominate our lives or relationships. While there may be times when making calculated decisions or manipulating a situation is necessary, it should not be our default mode of operation. Instead, we should embrace the idea that things happen naturally. They occur because of who we are and who others are. Sometimes, events are simply random, and we have to deal with them accordingly. Rather than viewing life as a world that needs to be controlled to fit our desires, we should adopt the mindset that things happen, and it is our responsibility to respond with love, care, and respect.

Rather than obsessing over trying to control the future, I direct my attention to the present moment and ask myself, 'How can I best handle this?' For instance, if someone is rude to me, I consider the most effective way to respond. Should I let anger consume me? Should I retaliate with aggression? Should I scream and shout? No, none of those options are low entropy choices. They only exacerbate the situation. The key is to respond with care and compassion. To genuinely care for the person who has upset me and for everything else that matters in this world. You see, when we act out of genuine concern, that's when things start to improve. So, instead of fixating on shaping the future to suit my desires, I simply allow things to unfold naturally. When someone is rude, I don't take it personally and think, 'Oh, this is about me and it's so unfair.' No, it's not about me at all. It's about them.

        "agent": "You know, it's not about me, it's about them. When someone is rude, it's a reflection of who they are, not who I am. The way I react to their rudeness is a reflection of my own character. You see, we often get this backwards. We think that their rudeness is a personal attack on us, and it makes us angry because we feel like we don't deserve it. But the truth is, their rudeness is their own problem. They need to address the fear or insecurity that is causing them to behave that way. It's not my responsibility to fix them or explain to them why they shouldn't be rude to me. They are who they are, and I need to accept that and decide how I'm going to handle it. This perspective is different from what we're used to in life, but it can be a powerful strategy. When I adopt this mindset, I don't have to have a rigid plan for how things should go. I simply deal with whatever comes my way to the best of my ability. And whatever happens, happens. Other people have to do the same. We're all just doing our best to navigate through life and make choices that serve us. This shifts the focus from trying to control the outside world to focusing on optimizing my own choices and reactions. Instead of trying to control the outcome, I focus on how I can respond in a way that aligns with my values and goals."

        "agent": "As I see it, the key is to focus on optimizing our choices rather than trying to control and optimize the outside world and its outcomes. By prioritizing our own decision-making process, we can create a more fulfilling life. If we find ourselves lacking joy, peace, and happiness, it's an indication that there is room for improvement in our choices. Making choices based on love and positivity can lead to a sense of peace, tranquility, and overall well-being. So, one strategy is to identify any negativity we experience and trace it back to its root cause, which is often fear. Once we understand the fear behind our negative emotions, we can work on addressing and overcoming it. For example, if we find ourselves getting angry or upset because things aren't going our way, it's important to recognize that this is driven by our ego and a desire for control. Accepting the way things are and dealing with them without getting upset is a more effective choice. Getting upset only worsens the situation and adds no value. It's crucial to understand that there is no benefit in making choices that make our situation worse. Therefore, it's essential to confront and overcome our fears.

        "questioner": "When faced with fear, what is the most effective approach to overcoming it and why is courage the key to conquering our fears?",
        "agent": "Well, when it comes to fear, it's really about not being treated the way we want to be treated. So, the question is, why do we feel the need to be treated that way? If we trace it back, we'll likely find some sort of fear at the root. Now, where that fear originated from may not be as important as we think. Sure, we can go back and say, 'Oh yeah, I remember. I'm afraid of dogs because a big dog scared me once,' or 'My mother used to beat me with a fly swatter, so now I'm afraid of fly swatters.' Often, we can trace these fears back to our childhood and find the experiences that shaped them. But dwelling on those roots isn't really necessary. We don't have to dig up the past and blame our parents or some accident we had years ago. While it may provide temporary relief by shifting the blame away from ourselves, it's not a helpful or effective approach. Blame is just another negative emotion that doesn't serve us. What we truly need is to stop blaming ourselves in the first place. Blaming others won't solve anything. Instead, we need to find the courage to face our fears head-on. Courage is the only antidote to fear. There's no other way around it. When you encounter fear, your initial instinct might be to make excuses or brush it off, but that won't help in the long run. The key is to confront your fears with courage and overcome them."

        "agent": "I find that when fear arises, my initial inclination is to make excuses for it, to justify it, and say that it's perfectly normal and acceptable. However, upon further reflection, I realize that there is indeed something wrong with that mindset. It affects the choices I make in various aspects of my life, even those that are unrelated to the source of fear. Therefore, it is crucial to have the courage to confront and acknowledge that fear. By facing it, I mean accepting it, but not necessarily liking it. Acceptance, in this context, means taking ownership of the fear. It means acknowledging that I am prone to feeling inadequate, needing validation from others, and becoming anxious if I don't receive it. Once I accept these aspects of myself, I can then decide whether I want to continue holding onto them or let them go. Letting go is challenging because there is a fear that if I do, nobody will like me unless I constantly put on a facade of happiness and extroversion. Deep down, I know that this is not the real me. However, I also know that behaving in this way elicits the desired reactions from others. I am aware that if I stop pretending and being someone I'm not, I might become invisible and unnoticed. This fear of being overlooked is something that requires courage to overcome."

        "questioner": "If you're concerned about the fear of becoming unnoticed and insignificant, how can accepting and embracing your authentic self help diminish the power of fear and allow you to navigate through life with confidence?",
        "agent": "Well, if you're worried about becoming unnoticed and insignificant, that's a common fear. But you know what? I've learned that it's okay if nobody notices me. I can still navigate through life just fine. It's not as big of a problem as it seems. I have the courage to accept that I might be an invisible person. And you know what happens when you accept that? You take away the power of fear. Fear feeds on the idea that nobody will like you or pay attention to you because deep down, you feel inadequate or unworthy. But here's the thing, you just have to embrace that and say, 'Okay, maybe I am inadequate and maybe I don't have much to offer.' And that's okay because I'm going to be true to myself. I'm going to be authentic. It takes courage to be authentic because now you have to go out into the world and be unapologetically you. That's where we're headed. Embrace your authenticity and be who you truly are. When you let go of fear, you're not driven by fear in your interactions with others. You're just being yourself. And once you fully accept that, fear loses its power because you've already acknowledged it and owned it. So now, what can fear really do to you?"

        "questioner": "How does accepting and embracing your authentic self help diminish the power of fear and enable you to overcome the obstacles that come with it?",
        "agent": "When you accept and own your fear, it loses its power to bite you. It becomes nothing more than smoke, an illusion that dissipates into thin air. You realize that the fear was never real to begin with. It was just a figment of your imagination. And once you let go of that fear, it feels like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders. You no longer feel the need to seek attention or validation through external means like jokes, appearance, or social status. You realize that you don't need all those things to be happy and fulfilled. You can just be yourself, and that's enough. Dealing with fears requires courage, and while it may be easier said than done, it's essential to push through the fear and be authentic. It takes real courage to face your fears head-on, even when they're telling you to run and hide. Start by tackling smaller fears, ones that may upset or aggravate you. Working on these smaller fears will build your courage and make it easier to face bigger fears in the future. Once you conquer a significant fear, no matter how small it may seem, you'll experience a profound difference. It's like the difference between day and night. You'll feel so much better because that fear is no longer holding you back."

        "questioner": "How can changing your perspective and accepting people as they are, without being fixated on goals, help improve your relationships and overall experience in life?",
        "agent": "I feel the difference. It is day and night, and I'll feel so much better because that negativity is gone. When people say things like that now, instead of getting upset, I have no negative reaction at all. If anything, I wonder why they feel that way. Maybe they don't understand or maybe I've given them the wrong impression about what's going on. Sometime when this situation changes, I'll see if I can do things to make it better for them. Now I'm thinking about how I can improve their experience, rather than focusing on what they did to me. So I've changed my perspective and I can make things better. Most arguments and conflicts arise from misinformation. People have different viewpoints and perspectives than I do. And if I try to see their perspective, even if it's wrong, it becomes more understandable. I'm not as upset about it anymore, and maybe I can even offer some help. So, if you understand my point, this is how you should change your approach to life. Stop trying to control everything. Stop trying to force a specific outcome. Don't be so fixated on goals, especially in your relationships. You can have goals for paying your mortgage or putting gas in the car, but don't be too focused on goals when dealing with people. Let people be who they are and accept it. Okay? So, that's how it relates to me."

        "agent": "So, what does it have to do with me? Well, as you grow up, not only does your life improve, but the lives of the people you're in a relationship with also improve. When relationships improve, the connections between people become stronger. You have the power to change their perspective. Instead of reacting with anger when someone says something rude to you, you can choose to smile and not let it affect you. Later, you can try to understand the problem and find a solution. By doing this, you help them let go of their rudeness, and eventually, they start questioning their own behavior. They realize that their rudeness doesn't elicit a reaction from you. It becomes a game that you refuse to play. Most people find meaning in their lives through these conflicts and relationships. But once you break that cycle, when others are rude to you and you don't respond in kind, they start reflecting on their own behavior. They begin to think, 'Am I being rude? Do I need to change? Do I need to grow up?'"

        "agent": "When I realize that people might think I'm rude, it makes me reflect on the need for change and personal growth. It's important to clean up my own act and understand others' perspectives by engaging in conversations with them. By changing myself, I have the power to influence and inspire others to grow as well. It may seem overwhelming to think about saving the world as just one person, but the truth is, every interaction we have with others has the potential to make a positive impact. Even simple acts of kindness, like being loving and caring towards the cashier at a grocery store, can brighten someone's day and create a ripple effect of positivity. It's through these small interactions that we can truly make a difference in the world. The key to saving the world lies in overcoming our fears and focusing on our own personal growth. We shouldn't feel responsible for fixing others, but rather, we should focus on fixing ourselves. This may raise some questions, but it's important to note that we have the ability to shape the future by modifying probabilities. In this virtual reality..."

        "agent": "I have this amazing ability, which I find truly fascinating, to alter the probability of future events within this virtual reality. There are two databases, one for the past and one for the probable future. And that probable future can be influenced, to some extent, by our intentions. Our thoughts have the power to shape what unfolds next. This is exactly how the placebo effect operates. When you believe you will get better and approach your recovery with a positive attitude, you actually do experience improvement. By directing your intent towards healing rather than dwelling on negative thoughts, you enhance your recovery process. Negative energy, on the other hand, hinders your progress and exacerbates the situation. But with a positive attitude, you start to heal. You begin to feel better, and you take action towards your well-being. It's the power of positivity. Our intentions have the ability to alter the probability of future outcomes. This is how we heal ourselves and even others, simply through the power of our minds. It's important to be mindful of our intentions. When we harbor negativity, misery, and resentment towards others, our intentions become negative and miserable. Consequently, we contribute to creating a negative and miserable reality for ourselves. However, once we let go of fear, we start to manifest a positive and joyful reality for ourselves. And as we continue on this journey of self-discovery and growth, we..."

        "agent": "Once you let go of fear, you start creating a positive and joyful reality for yourself. It's interesting how, when fear is eliminated, it feels like you have complete control. But in reality, you release control altogether and simply embrace whatever comes your way. You handle it to the best of your ability, accepting that whatever happens is just the way it is. At this level, you'll notice that the experiences that come your way are all incredibly pleasant and wonderful. It's as if the universe aligns with your desires. As you encounter new things to learn or tasks to accomplish, they effortlessly unfold right in front of you. You might think, 'I really need to learn this' or 'I need to go there' or 'I need to find out about this.' And within minutes, someone appears and provides you with all the information you were seeking. Life becomes a series of mysterious synchronicities, where everything falls into place exactly when you need it. You engage with the world around you, without the need to control anything, because everything that comes your way is beneficial. It's enlightening and even the challenging or painful experiences hold valuable lessons. You don't focus on the pain, as you know you can handle it. You face it head-on, knowing that it's not a big deal. When faced with difficult situations, you see the lesson and the growth opportunity they present."

        "agent": "When faced with a difficult situation, I believe it's important to approach it with the best of my abilities. I see these challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. Instead of succumbing to fear, I choose to tackle them with love and resilience. It's almost like playing a game, similar to World of Warcraft, where you embark on missions and quests. In this case, my quest is to handle whatever comes my way. Even though my car unexpectedly broke down in the middle of nowhere between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, I view it as an adventure. Let's see how this unfolds. I'm curious about what's next. By maintaining a positive mindset, I avoid dwelling on negative possibilities and attracting them into my reality. Instead, I focus on the positive outcomes and intentions. Interestingly, when you radiate positivity, you'll often find that help comes your way. For instance, when I step out of my broken-down car, it's not uncommon for someone to stop and offer assistance. They might ask if I need a ride, offer to take me to a gas station, or even come back to help fix my car. It's amazing how a positive attitude can attract positive experiences. As Dogda mentioned the other night, she noticed a change in how people treated her when she shifted her attitude. It may seem puzzling, but it's a testament to the power of our mindset."

        "agent": "I changed my attitude and suddenly people started to be nicer to me. You might wonder how that works, but that's exactly why it works. When you change your attitude, people tend to respond more positively. We could continue discussing this topic at length. By the way, do you know what time it is? Timekeepers are the ones responsible for keeping track of time. They ensure that everything runs smoothly. It's fascinating to think about how we could go on indefinitely without breaks or even food. However, let's take a break here for now. It's interesting to realize that we have the ability to govern ourselves without relying on external timekeepers."
