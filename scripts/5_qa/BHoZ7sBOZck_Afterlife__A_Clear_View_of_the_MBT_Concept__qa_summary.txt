    "Tom Campbell is asked about his theory on afterlife and communication with the deceased. The questioner reads excerpts from questions they received, which express disappointment that Campbell's theory suggests there is no real afterlife, only an archive of memories. Campbell explains that it depends on how one defines \"real communication\" and \"afterlife.\" He believes that consciousness is fundamental and that identifying with consciousness allows for the possibility of an afterlife and communication with the deceased. However, if one identifies solely with their avatar, then there is no afterlife for that avatar. It all comes down to how one defines the terms and what they identify with.",

If one identifies solely with their avatar, then there is no afterlife for that avatar. However, if one identifies with consciousness, then there is an afterlife. Consciousness is fundamental, and it continues to learn, grow, and have experiences even after the death of the avatar. When communicating with a deceased person, one is communicating directly with consciousness that is constrained by that person's information. The person being communicated with is not the same person they were when they were alive, but rather a subset of the larger consciousness system. Campbell's theory suggests that there is not a traditional afterlife that some people may hope for, but it is still an afterlife nonetheless.",

The avatar is immortal, not consciousness, and continues on with the same set of limitations, beliefs, fears, ego, and lack of knowledge and information. Any individual is limited in what they know and understand based on their life experiences. If one identifies solely with their avatar, then they're limited to that same set of experiences and knowledge, which can be very limiting in terms of growth and understanding after death.

    "Tom Campbell discusses the inefficiency of the avatar carrying on and how it may not be comforting for people to think that they won't carry on. He explains that diversity and efficiency are the concepts that continue us to evolve. However, he points out that if we have a reality where dead people live and interact, it becomes a difficult problem. In 100 years, every person alive now will be dead, and there will be nine more billion people there. The next hundred years will see another nine billion people, and by then, it'll probably be ten or 15 billion people. The influx of people from different cultures and beliefs will make it a complex issue that requires careful consideration and planning.",
    "Tom Campbell discusses the challenges of a hypothetical reality where dead people live and interact, and the influx of people from different cultures and beliefs. He notes that this is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and planning. One potential solution could be to create another physical reality where dead people can continue to have relationships, get married, have children, and so on. However, this would require a very large place that every hundred years gets billions of new people. Another potential solution could be to have a big chat room where dead people can interact with each other socially, but this could potentially lead to clicks and division, which would not promote growth and diversity. Additionally, there will be a lot of people there who aren't very grown, as typically people aren't very grown. Ultimately, finding a solution to this hypothetical scenario will require a lot of careful consideration and planning, especially given the influx of people from different cultures and beliefs.",
    "Tom Campbell discusses the challenges of a hypothetical reality where dead people live and interact, and the influx of people from different cultures and beliefs. He notes that creating another physical reality or a big chat room for dead people to interact with each other socially is not very efficient or effective. Instead, he suggests thinking of oneself as consciousness rather than an avatar. This approach would make the scenario more efficient and effective, and would promote growth and diversity in this hypothetical reality where dead people live and interact. When one thinks of oneself as consciousness rather than an avatar, it becomes a lot simpler, more efficient, and more effective. When one's avatar dies, they just get another avatar and continue on. This approach would address the issues of growth and diversity because it allows for a more fluid and adaptable system. It also allows for a greater understanding and acceptance of different cultures and beliefs, as we are all just pieces of consciousness playing different avatars.

    "Tom Campbell explains to the questioner that diversity is key to lowering entropy and growing up. He compares it to the old days when only wealthy people could travel and those who did were considered sophisticated while those who didn't were considered provincial. He says that having a diverse set of experiences is much more efficient in growing up quickly than taking the same package and trying to run it forever. He adds that having a limited set of experiences like Susie Q's avatar is not ideal as it only has maybe one 10th of 1% of all the experiences that were available.",
    "Tom Campbell emphasizes the importance of having a diverse set of experiences in order to grow up and lower entropy. He explains that relying on a limited set of experiences, like Susie Q's avatar, is not ideal as it only provides a small fraction of the experiences available. Instead, having a diverse set of experiences allows individuals to become more sophisticated, educated, and grown up by exposing them to different races, genders, socioeconomic statuses, and health statuses. \n\nCampbell provides examples of how experiencing different perspectives can help individuals see the world from a bigger perspective. For instance, experiencing different races can help individuals understand how people from different backgrounds are treated differently and how that affects their lives. Similarly, experiencing different socioeconomic backgrounds can help individuals understand the different opportunities and challenges that people face. \n\nIn summary, Campbell stresses that having a diverse set of experiences is key to growing up and lowering entropy. It allows individuals to see the world from a bigger perspective and understand how everything is interconnected.",

By realizing that the avatar doesn't actually exist and is just eye candy for us to look at, individuals can start to see themselves as part of a bigger whole.

    "Tom Campbell explains that the database of all the information that was in an avatar is not just an archive for comforting the loved ones of the deceased. The database is necessary for the system to render the virtual reality by keeping track of the probabilities of the possibilities.

However, he realized that if he said exactly the same thing in exactly the same way, he would get exactly the same result.

    "Tom Campbell, an agent, has been exploring the afterlife through his ability to control his consciousness and access databases on demand.

He also tested the idea that he could interact with people in the afterlife. He found that he could change the way he interacted with people, and if he changed the way he interacted with them, it would change the way they'd interact. It would bring up different things and change the conversation. He realized that he was a part of that system, but it didn't reflect back up to the present.

He also realized that if he said exactly the same thing in exactly the same way, he'd get exactly the same result. If he did something different, he'd get a different result. But if he did that same different thing again, he'd get the same different result. This told him that it was a database. He could ask not only to see the things that happened, but he could get off of that thin thread and get into the possibilities, the things that could have happened.\n\nOverall, Campbell's experiments and experiences have led him to a deeper understanding of the nature of consciousness and the afterlife.

    "Tom Campbell, a physicist and consciousness explorer, explains that his book, which outlines his theory of everything, is based on years of research and experimentation. He began his journey as a consciousness explorer in the 1970s while working with Bob Monroe. Over the decades, he conducted experiments and changed variables to gain a deeper understanding of how consciousness and virtual reality work. As a physicist, he looked at all the facts he had uncovered and developed a model that would answer all of them. It wasn't until the mid to late 1990s that he was finally able to write his book. All of the facts and experiences he had accumulated over the years were crucial in helping him develop his theory of everything.",

    "Tom Campbell, a physicist and consciousness explorer, has written a book called \"My Big Toe\" based on his theory of everything, which he developed over years of research and experimentation. He began his journey as a consciousness explorer in the 1970s while working with Bob Monroe. Over the decades, he conducted experiments and changed variables to gain a deeper understanding of how consciousness and virtual reality work. As a physicist, he looked at all the facts he had uncovered and developed a model that would answer all of them.\n\nWhen asked about how he created the subjective facts that he uses to explain the subjective world in his book, Campbell explained that he realized he needed a model that would answer all the facts, not just from the physical reality or the subjective world, but a bigger understanding that overarchs both of those. He created the subjective facts through his own 35 years of research, trial and error, and seeing what was connected to what. He figured out how one thing affects another, which is the same way people figured it out in the physical world. It's the same process. That's how science is done. It's trial and error. And you've tried to figure out what affects other things and why.\n\nCampbell believes that his book can help readers understand the science of the subjective world and how it works, just as they can understand the science of the physical world through physics. In his book, he explains both the subjective and objective world equally. He believes that there is science now on both sides of that as far as understanding why things are the way they are, how they work, what do you have to do to make them better? So it's clear now, in both the subjective and the objective world, there's a science that covers both of it. That's basically what the \"My Big Toe\" is. The reason that there aren't a whole lot of people competing with him with this book is that there's just not a whole lot of people who have both sets of skills. You have to be able to research with an open mind and be willing to change your mind when the facts don't support your theory.",

He believes that to develop a theory of everything that encompasses both the subjective and objective worlds, one has to be able to research within consciousness, to explore the consciousness from the inside, and also understand physics. Campbell's background in both fields has contributed to his success in this field. As a physicist, he was able to look at all the facts he had uncovered through his consciousness exploration and develop a model that would answer all of them.

The questioner expresses gratitude for the insights gained from the conversation, particularly regarding the concept of the database and its role in the afterlife. Tom responds by emphasizing the positive aspects of the afterlife, noting that consciousness is immortal and that individuals have the opportunity to learn and grow. He suggests that this process leads to greater understanding of the world and better relationships with others. While acknowledging that some may struggle with fear, beliefs, and ego, Tom believes that these obstacles can be overcome with effort, leading to a satisfying and enjoyable life.",

Tom responded by emphasizing the positive aspects of the afterlife, noting that consciousness is immortal and that individuals have the opportunity to learn and grow. He suggested that this process leads to greater understanding of the world and better relationships with others. \n\nWhen asked how consciousness continues to grow and evolve beyond the limitations of the avatar, Tom explained that as consciousness, individuals grow up as an avatar, but they are not just a calculation. They are beings that get to learn and grow. As they continue to learn and grow, they gain a bigger picture and understanding of the world around them. This allows them to be happy, joyful, and well-connected with others. It becomes easier to have good relationships and all the things that everyone wants in life. It's satisfying, and you enjoy it. It's a challenge, a game that you're playing, and it takes skill, perseverance, and effort to do well in this game. But it's fun. Even when it hurts, it's still fun. It still works.\n\nTom further explained that when an avatar is done, it's done. For example, when Aunt Susie and Uncle Fred pass on, that avatar is just retired. There'll never be another Susie or Uncle Fred. They were a one-off. They made their choices, they learned, they grew, they loved, they cared, and their consciousness was better off because of it. And that consciousness went on to then be other people and other relationships and more loved ones and more wonderful experiences helping each other grow up. This is the positive thing going on. It's not like taking a very limited Aunt Susie and making her deal with those limitations forever. That wouldn't be very profitable, though it might in the end, after a lot of pain and suffering, lead to growth.\n\nTom acknowledged that some may struggle with fear, beliefs, and ego. But in time, those things can be overcome. Life becomes satisfying, enjoyable, and a challenge that you get to play. It takes effort, but it's worth it. As individuals continue to learn and grow, they gain a bigger picture and understanding of the world around them, which allows them to be happy, joyful, and well-connected with others. It becomes easier to have good relationships and all the things that everyone wants in life. In short, consciousness continues to grow and evolve beyond the limitations of the avatar by learning, growing, and experiencing new things. This process leads to greater understanding and better relationships with others.",
