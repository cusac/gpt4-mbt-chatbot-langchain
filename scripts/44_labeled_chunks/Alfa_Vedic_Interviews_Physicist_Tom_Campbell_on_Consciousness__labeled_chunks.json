  "Mike Winter:: And boom, we are back for another episode of AlphaCasts.\nMike Winter:: My name's Mike Winter.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: I'm here as always with Dr. Bear Paul Lando.\nMike Winter:: So today we have someone I've been really looking forward to talking to Tom Campbell.",
  "Dr. Bear Paul Lando:: You know, I did my own journey through medicine\nMike Winter:: And especially when I got out in practice,\nTom Campbell:: You know, you mentioned that if you go back what 2,000 years",
  "Mike Winter:: Well, and it is fun.\nTom Campbell:: Yes and yes.",
  "Mike Winter:: So I was just wanted to ask Tom, do you feel like we're moving into an era of new consciousness exploration?\nTom Campbell:: Yes and yes.",
  "Mike Winter:: There's little bubbles of enlightenment out there that finds better ways of doing things and better ways of thinking.\nTom Campbell:: Well, today, what is mainstream has a lot to do with science.",
  "Speaker1:: with the great clockwork universe.\nSpeaker1:: That's where science is.\nSpeaker1:: They've never really moved on.\nSpeaker1:: Because though they were excited back in the 1920s\nSpeaker1:: about this new idea and something other than materialism,\nSpeaker1:: they didn't know what to do with it.\nSpeaker1:: They couldn't take the next step.\nSpeaker1:: They didn't have any logic to derive it.\nSpeaker1:: It was just the result of the experiment.\nSpeaker1:: OK, now, so what's the theory?\nSpeaker1:: Why is it like that?\nSpeaker1:: What's the overall picture?\nSpeaker1:: Well, they didn't have an overall picture.\nSpeaker1:: The only picture they had was the one Newton handed them.\nSpeaker1:: Plus, they were able to do calculations in quantum physics\nSpeaker1:: and get right answers.\nSpeaker1:: But they didn't understand it.\nSpeaker1:: So they called it weird science.\nSpeaker1:: They didn't call it science that's logical.\nSpeaker1:: All the rest of science is logical.\nSpeaker1:: But quantum physics is weird science.\nSpeaker1:: It's weird because it doesn't follow materialism.\nSpeaker1:: So instead of continuing to search for that understanding,\nSpeaker1:: instead, they took the easy road out, which was, oh,\nSpeaker1:: it's just weird science.\nSpeaker1:: It's always going to be weird science.\nSpeaker1:: It's something we'll never know.\nSpeaker1:: We just have to deal with it as weird science.\nSpeaker1:: There is no answer.\nSpeaker1:: We just accepted as weird science\nSpeaker1:: and stopped looking for a theory behind it.\nSpeaker1:: So they did.\nSpeaker1:: So after 20 or 30 years of banging their heads against that wall,\nSpeaker1:: they finally gave up and said, it's just weird science.\nSpeaker1:: Nobody will ever know.\nSpeaker1:: Let's go on.\nSpeaker1:: And they kind of stopped looking for an answer.\nSpeaker1:: Well, now the quantum mechanics has grown and grown.\nSpeaker1:: And instead of doing just the double slit,\nSpeaker1:: now there's 100 experiments that all say the same thing.\nSpeaker1:: It's not materialistic.\nSpeaker1:: It's information.\nSpeaker1:: That's what reality is built out of.\nSpeaker1:: It's built out of information.\nSpeaker1:: Double slit told them that when they realized\nSpeaker1:: that the experimenter, what the experimenter knew,\nSpeaker1:: changed the results of the experimenter, of the experiment.\nSpeaker1:: You see, the person looks at the which way data, which\nSpeaker1:: slit the particle goes through, and you get one answer.\nSpeaker1:: They don't look at it.\nSpeaker1:: You get a different answer.\nSpeaker1:: So why does what the experimenter now\nSpeaker1:: changed the nature of reality?\nSpeaker1:: You see, that was what double slit brought.\nSpeaker1:: Well, now they've done similar experiments that\nSpeaker1:: aren't just double slit, but a whole bunch of experiments.\nSpeaker1:: And they all say the same thing.\nSpeaker1:: And that is this reality is information-based.\nSpeaker1:: Matter of fact, I was listening to a video\nSpeaker1:: of some guys that were looking at the big atom smasher over\nSpeaker1:: in CERN.\nSpeaker1:: You remember back about six or seven years ago\nSpeaker1:: when the god particle, the Higgs boson, was a big deal.\nSpeaker1:: The hydrogen glider.\nSpeaker1:: Yeah.\nSpeaker1:: So they were over there and they were interviewed.\nSpeaker1:: And I was listening to this interview.\nSpeaker1:: And this part of it just jumped out at me,\nSpeaker1:: because it's so obviously true.\nSpeaker1:: And that the scientists there were saying, look,\nSpeaker1:: we don't really think of the electron anymore\nSpeaker1:: as a piece of mass with a charge.\nSpeaker1:: That's the way we used to think of it.\nSpeaker1:: But that doesn't work.\nSpeaker1:: We can't use that information and compute right answers.\nSpeaker1:: We think of an electron as a point\nSpeaker1:: with the attributes of mass and the attributes of charge.\nSpeaker1:: Well, you see, attributes are just information.\nSpeaker1:: So they think of the electron as information.\nSpeaker1:: And with that, they can compute the right answers\nSpeaker1:: with their quantum physics to predict\nSpeaker1:: what the results of those atoms smashing together\nSpeaker1:: are going to produce.\nSpeaker1:: So what we've had now is that physicists probably\nSpeaker1:: a pretty large minority of ph",
  "Speaker1:: \"at doesn't work.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"We can't use that information and compute right answers.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"We think of an electron as a point with the attributes of mass and the attributes of charge.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"Well, you see, attributes are just information.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"So they think of the electron as information.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"And with that, they can compute the right answers with their quantum physics to predict what the results of those atoms smashing together are going to produce.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"So what we've had now is that physicists probably a pretty large minority of physicists say that our reality is information based, because physics has just been telling them now for about 100 years.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"That's the way it is.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"Well, they don't really know what to do with that.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"See, they're right back where they were back in the 1920s after Einstein and Bohr and Heisenberg and Vigner and all those guys came up with a double slit experiment.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"They know that it's information based, but they don't know what to do about that.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"OK, so it's information based.\"\nSpeaker3:: \"Now what?\"",
  "Tom Campbell:: So where does that leave us?\nMike Winter:: Now we apply that to us, whatever you have.\nTom Campbell:: I posit a larger consciousness system, which is all of consciousness.\nMike Winter:: I was going to say you're kind of getting into the grand concept of most mysticism, which is this idea of whatever you want to call it, the ether, the source, the mana, this idea that there is this overriding essence of reality that everything springs from.\nTom Campbell:: Purpose is to evolve the quality of consciousness.\nMike Winter:: Tom, how can we start applying this knowledge in more practical sense to apply the change we want to see right now in the world?",
  "Mike Winter:: is done by lowering the entropy\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: All right, so all this ties together.\nTom Campbell:: That is taking random bits and turning them into something",
  "Mike Winter:: that'll seem immediately that that's a big step,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: See, love is the answer.\nTom Campbell:: What's our purpose?",
  "Mike Winter:: which is totally inclusive, it excludes no one.\nAll people with all ideas, you know,\ncan fit into this group, can find themselves\nin this kind of a model.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Well, the ironic thing too, Tom,\nTom Campbell:: On the other hand, if you take the opposite corner",
  "Tom Campbell:: you're a determinist,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: On the other hand, if you take the opposite corner\nTom Campbell:: Okay, well, what does your experience tell you?\nTom Campbell:: Tell you, which of those is true?\nTom Campbell:: You see, and it's pretty obvious\nTom Campbell:: So I think now we are at a spot\nTom Campbell:: And when they finally get that rock off out of that divot\nTom Campbell:: That's when the physicists say, yes, this is a virtual reality.\nTom Campbell:: And in an environment where we're all together communicating,\nTom Campbell:: And if we all get to this idea that we are consciousness\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And I think when science gets to the point\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And people that harbor any emotions other than love\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And so when science can measure love,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: So do you have any thoughts on the possibili",
  "Mike Winter:: Observing that love is the ultimate entropy,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And people that harbor any emotions other than love\nTom Campbell:: Yeah, absolutely.",
  "Mike Winter:: enough people thinking along these lines\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And in that case, I see a big jump forward in the near future.\nMike Winter:: And yes, we couldn't do it without technology.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Well, one thing we always say, Tom, is humanity us.\nTom Campbell:: Yeah, it's interesting.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And I think as long as you don't watch television,\nTom Campbell:: Yeah, absolutely.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Even if we go that way, we will turn around and go back the other way.\nTom Campbell:: Absolutely.",
  "Mike Winter:: here one day.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Absolutely. The thing is, how long is that going to take?\nMike Winter:: You know, you know, yes, it could take as short as a, you know, three or four or five years,\nthat's possible. I generally am not that optimistic.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: I am an optimist, but I think I'm being optimist when I'm saying a couple of decades, you know,\nat the least.\nMike Winter:: Oh, I agree. What I mean by that, I mean kind of consensus of moving of next three or four years,\nmore and more of the mainstream coming to conclusions that we have already, that you have already,\nthat that becoming more mainstream and the idea of it, not the actual implementation,\nthe actual change, but the fact that we're, and we've already seen it simulation theory is to run\naround everywhere. Yes.\nTom Campbell:: Now, I bring up The Matrix for a reason. This is something that's always interesting.",
  "Mike Winter:: That intuitive side is just\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And we can get into those databases.\nTom Campbell:: But when we, we will work with it, this is the point you're getting.",
  "Mike Winter:: to harness that intuitive side and take advantage of that.\nTom Campbell:: Now, if we take advantage of it for our ego and because we want to control other people, well, that has a very, you know, that doesn't work very well.",
  "Mike Winter:: just give some practical advice to\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: people listening going, how can I start doing this? What is in your mind the best way to get\nMike Winter:: start going into this stuff and then so that they could be prepped and ready if they are\nMike Winter:: in that space of mind and heart to start doing this stuff because not everybody's ready to start\nMike Winter:: doing this. Everyone's on a different path. But what in your, and I have a feeling you're going\nMike Winter:: to say meditation, but what's the best way to start really getting into this? And then how can we\nMike Winter:: start moving forward into those coursework that you provide so that we can start playing with\nMike Winter:: our consciousness more because I feel like that's paramount for everybody now. Okay, well, I'll give\nTom Campbell:: a short view of this, a very quick view of it. And then I can tell them some resources they can\nTom Campbell:: use where they can get a whole lot more detail. Fantastic. Yes, meditation is a piece of it,\nTom Campbell:: but it's not the whole piece. Meditation gives you one of the attributes that's necessary and that",
  "Mike Winter:: If you're right-brain, well, that's what makes you right-brain.\nMike Winter:: But if you're not, and in our culture, you know, we reward left-brain kind of thinking,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Now, if you can do that, the rest of it is easy and just takes a little practice.\nMike Winter:: Well,\nMike Winter:: out of body is a very poor name.",
  "Mike Winter:: So you just want to check it out.\nTom Campbell:: In consciousness, the, the, the searching the database is a thousand, maybe a million times faster than it is in searching, searching Google.\nMike Winter:: It's only microseconds, you know, that, that before you get the answer back from consciousness query.\nTom Campbell:: So do your remote viewing, not just in the whole thing, but look at attributes of the thing.",
  "Tom Campbell:: Well, it's going to be. But just write everything down and don't try to make sense of it.\nMike Winter:: So just take the data and put it down.\nTom Campbell:: Well, I feel like there's lines going like this. So just put lines like that on my paper.",
  "Tom Campbell:: other individuated consciousness,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: whether it be your friend that goes, that you can meet.\nTom Campbell:: And so I've read a lot on this, and I understand that there's other realities that\nare collectively controlled consciousness realities where all the people form that reality together.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Right. So my guess my point is these virtue, a lot of people believe, well, that's just your own\nTom Campbell:: dream. That's just a trippy dream. But I think it's important to understand these are have objective\nrule sets that others can experience the same because they have an objective reality to themselves.",

  "Mike Winter:: If you go on, if we go on downhill to one that's not so good, your ego says, wow, powers, I'd like to have those powers.\nTom Campbell:: Tom, have you ever had experiences with negative entities? \nMike Winter:: I know when I was in high school and slipping out of out of body and having these experiences, I had a weird experience that kind of shook me to the core where I felt there was a presence in my parents bathroom.",
  "Mike Winter:: to have, you know, you're you're you're heading in the wrong direction.\nTom Campbell:: Tom, have you ever had experiences with negative entities?\nTom Campbell:: I've been through all of that too.",
  "No speaker present in this transcript portion.",
  "Mike Winter:: Well, my thoughts on that are that if one uses that once or twice in order to blast themselves into the larger system, and it will do that, it is blasting you into the larger system.\nTom Campbell:: And the reason for that is you don't evolve, you don't grow up because you've had an experience.",
  "No speaker present in this transcript portion.",
  "Mike Winter:: Absolutely. Well, they're convinced in their own mind that they are more spiritual, more understanding that their understanding is greater than other people.\nTom Campbell:: Yeah, you know what it is, it's like this, all this, this trend is don't take shortcuts.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Same with the health world. Oh, I've got a symptom. Let's go to the doctor to give me some external thing to fix myself instead of me looking internally to see what's causing that.\nTom Campbell:: Yeah, I figured out some of it. You know, it's hard when you're looking upstream to figure things out.",
  "Mike Winter:: And have you figured out why they kicked you out\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: Yeah, I figured out some of it. \nTom Campbell:: You know, it's hard when you're looking upstream to figure things out.",
  "N/A",
  "Mike Winter:: I remember telling some guy who was here from Poland, actually,\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And when we had the Czechoslovakia broke out a spring, you know,\nTom Campbell:: Tom Campbell, a physicist and consciousness researcher, believes that consciousness is an information system that aims to evolve the quality of consciousness by reducing entropy.",

  "Tom Campbell:: Oh, yeah, you can heal all sorts of things with your mind.\n",
  "Tom Campbell:: It's a whole lot stronger than the placebo effect.\nTom Campbell:: Sure. That is the result of your your intent, modified future probability, the future probability\nof being healthier rather than sicker.\nTom Campbell:: You can change that probability. And yes, I've done that\na lot.",
  "Mike Winter:: state and help them stay there.\nMike Winter:: But as I always tell them, it's just a tool.\nMike Winter:: So anyway, you could go there.\nMike Winter:: And they don't cost much.\nMike Winter:: So you could listen to that.\nMike Winter:: Go back, you can take the whole course for free.\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And we know binaural beats have been used like we had Sherry Edwards on\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: And I highly recommend reading Tom's\nDr. Bear Paul Lando:: I've only read the first book, but so far I'm loving it.\nTom Campbell:: Well, parting words would be,",
  "Mike Winter:: If you don't do anything else but that, that is your optimal\nBear Lando:: contribution to saving not only yourself but the world too.\nMike Winter:: That's the idea.\nMike Winter:: We look at the like the evil politician and the bad CEO and all these things.\nMike Winter:: If we could change them, that would fix things.\nMike Winter:: Those are symptoms.\nMike Winter:: They're not the problem.\nMike Winter:: The problem is a low quality of consciousness.\nMike Winter:: That's the problem.\nMike Winter:: And we can only fix that in ourselves.\nMike Winter:: You can't change anybody else.\nMike Winter:: So if you want to make the optimal change to this world,\nMike Winter:: if you want to make this world a kinder, gentler place, then your optimal contribution\nTom Campbell:: is to get rid of your own fear, get rid of your ego, get rid of your beliefs, become love.\nTom Campbell:: That's your optimal way for you to change the world."
