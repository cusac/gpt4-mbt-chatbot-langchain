  "Speaker2:: Good afternoon, Tom.\nTom:: Sure.",
  "Tom:: yes to. I also could say no to all those questions.\nTom:: There is no afterlife. It just depends on how you define the words we're talking about.\nTom:: Let's define them carefully. That is, in MBT, it's a theory based on consciousness. Consciousness is fundamental. It's all about consciousness. \nTom:: Now, to answer these questions and whether you get a yes or a no for the answer depends on what you identify with, who you think you are. \nTom:: If you think that you are the avatar, then if you're asking, does that avatar go on into an avatar's afterlife where that avatar, Susie Q, continues to be Susie Q and think like Susie Q and have Susie Q's memory, Susie Q's fears, Susie Q's attitudes and ideas and experience, beliefs, her ego, it's all Susie Q. It's just that avatar continues to go on as that avatar. Then no, there is no afterlife for the avatar. \nTom:: Now, if you identify yourself as consciousness, you're not an avatar, you're consciousness. You're the choice maker for the avatar. The avatar doesn't actually exist. The avatar is just a computation out of a computer, just like in our computer games. If we play the Sims and we've got a Sims character, that Sims character doesn't really exist. It's just information displayed on a computer screen. \nTom:: Okay, so it doesn't exist. So from that viewpoint that no, you're not the avatar, you are consciousness. So if you identify yourself with consciousness, then yes, there is an afterlife. Yes, consciousness survives the death of the avatar. Yes, consciousness goes on. Yes, consciousness continues to learn and grow and have experiences. Yes, when you talk to a person who's dead, you're talking directly with consciousness, consciousness that's constrained by that dead person's information. consciousness itself is information. \nTom:: Okay, so by that, I mean that the person who was an avatar had certain attitudes, ideas, again, fear, belief, egos, things that knew, experience, also had its own ignorance, things it didn't know, you know, things it wasn't aware of.",
  "Tom:: Yes, consciousness continues to learn and grow and have experiences.\nTom:: Okay, so by that, I mean that the person who was an avatar had certain attitudes, ideas, again, fear, belief, egos, things that knew, experience, also had its own ignorance, things it didn't know, you know, things it wasn't aware of. It's a limited set of experience.\nTom:: The larger conscious system can limit itself to that set of experience. So Susie Q dies. Susie Q had a limited set of experience.\nTom:: All the Susie Q's opinions, her attitudes, her feelings, her memory, her cares, her likes, her dislikes, her loves, it's all there. But it's the consciousness system playing Susie Q.\nTom:: If you're like, now, why would the system do that? The system does that for the benefit of the people who are still here in this virtual reality as avatars.\nTom:: So that's how that works. So it depends. If you see yourself as consciousness, yes, then you can speak to dead people. You do live on in an afterlife and that afterlife finds you growing and learning and becoming.\nTom:: People who identify as the avatar, they don't identify as consciousness. They think t",
  "Tom:: They still want that connection.\nTom:: So that's how that works.\nTom:: If you see yourself as consciousness, yes, then you can speak to dead people.\nTom:: Okay, now let's look at some of the ideas.\nTom:: People who identify as the avatar, they don't identify as consciousness. \nTom:: So they want that avatar to go on forever.\nTom:: So let's just take the idea that you are the avatar and that the avatar dies and the avatar continues to live.\nTom:: If that's the case, then you continue on with that same set of limitations. \nTom:: You're very limited in what you know and what you understand because you've just had that life experience that Susie Q who died has. \nTom:: So those limited experiences, as we know, when you get things that conflict with your, your, your sense of reality conflict with your beliefs, you just blow them off. \n",
  "Tom:: then you don't know anything about growing corn.\nTom:: You don't know anything about engineering.\nTom:: You don't know anything about a thousand different subjects.\nTom:: You're very limited in what you know and what you understand because you've just had that life experience that Susie Q who died has.\nTom:: So now you're going, that is going to go on.\nTom:: So those limited experiences, as we know, when you get things that conflict with your, your, your sense of reality conflict with your beliefs, you just blow them off.\nTom:: You don't consider them because they can possibly be true because you have a sense of what the truth is.\nTom:: That's why those limitations are a problem.\nTom:: That's why it's so hard to grow up and change yourself because as those changes come at you, the things that don't fit with your beliefs, you just blow them away, blow them away.\nTom:: Well, that can't be true. That can't be true. I just won't accept that.\nTom:: So the limitations tend to stay with you and you end up being stuck in that same rut and trying to work yourself out of that is a very difficult problem.\nTom:: And it would require now that the LCS have another whole virtual reality where these avatars interact with each other.\nTom:: Now you'd have to ask, well, what would that virtual reality be like?\nTom:: Do those dead avatars have relationships? Are they romantic? Do they have jobs? Do they have to go to work every day? What did they do?\nTom:: Just hang out, hang out like in a big chat room and just chat with each other forever.\nTom:: I mean, what's that reality going to be like?\nTom:: Is it going to be just like this one? But now it's only dead people, people who have died that you hang out with and all the people that have ever died all the way back to the caveman dragging his knuckles as he walks and whatever with very little information.",
  "Tom:: You've brought up a good point about the inefficiency of something like that, of the avatar being carrying on. \nTom:: If we have this reality where the dead people live and interact and grow and so on, and it's got everybody in it who's ever lived at all, now just think of what that does. \nTom:: Right now, we have about eight and a half to nine billion people. \nTom:: In 100 years, every one of those people that's here now will be dead because we don't tend to live more than 100 years. \nTom:: Just 100 years, there will be nine more billion people there. \nTom:: Now, the next 100 years, there'll be another nine. \nTom:: By then it'll probably be 10 or 15 billion people. \nTom:: You see what happens? It gets to be a very crowded place very soon. \nTom:: And these people come from such different cultures. \nSpeaker2:: But in your theory, diversity and efficiency is the concept that continues us to evolve us. Is that right?",
  "Tom:: 100 years. Just 100 years, there",
  "Tom:: Typically people aren't very grown. So they, it's not like these people, once they die suddenly, you know, have a lot of higher quality to them, they're still the same as they were, they have to outgrow it.\nTom:: But now outgrowing it in this cocktail party environment is going to be much harder than outgrowing it in the environment that consciousness would have. So you see, it's just a big problem.\nTom:: It doesn't work well, requires a lot more resources from the LCS, and it just grows and gets out of control. So that's kind of what's wrong with it. That's why it's inefficient.\nTom:: Instead of thinking that you are the avatar, and you as the avatar being immortal and going on, think of you as consciousness. You are a piece of consciousness. You're playing an avatar. That avatar doesn't actually exist.\nTom:: It's just like your Sims character, just like your elf in World of Warcraft. It's a computer creation that helps you see how interactions take place. You the consciousness, you're the player. Now when you have that idea, then it gets a lot simpler, a lot more efficient, and a lot more effective. Because now when your avatar dies, well, you just get another avatar and you continue to play.\nTom:: And that avatar is not stuck in the same rut, doesn't come with the same history and the same memories, the same hurts, the same joys. It doesn't get stuck in that. It starts over. It's got a whole new avatar to work with, with a whole new set of experiences, which gives it a take like all the baggage that people carry, you know, all the dislikes, all the slights, all the fact that they were abused as children, all of that stuff gets dropped by the doorstep.\nTom:: And now you just take the quality of that consciousness and you start over. So all the baggage gets jettisoned and you get to make a whole new set of choices in a completely different set of experiences. That's called diversity.",
  "Tom:: gives it a take like all the baggage that people carry,\nSpeaker2:: Doesn't this diversity allow you to, I mean, here in this lifetime, you think, you know,\nTom:: Well, sure. We'll see what you're trying to do here is grow up, lower your entropy.",
  "Tom:: Into the 16, 17 hundred travel was very expensive and very difficult to do.\nTom:: So mainly only wealthy people got around. And what we call those people is sophisticated if they traveled and provincial if they didn't.",
  "Tom:: If your avatar doesn't continue\nSpeaker2:: None\nTom:: on, but that you as consciousness continue on playing different avatars and it's so",
  "Tom:: It all just doesn't work very well, Donna.\nTom:: It works so much better if you see yourself as a consciousness, not an avatar.\nTom:: Once you realize that that avatar doesn't actually exist, there is no avatar.\nTom:: That's just eye candy for you to look at so that you can better understand the connections and interactions going on.\nTom:: That's the nature of a multiplayer game.\nTom:: The poor avatar dies.\nTom:: Let's go back to the concern with the databases being just archives.\nSpeaker2:: Now, those databases of all the information that was that avatar, all the rich memories, emotions, and things like that, that's kept by the LCS for a particular reason, for the reason of comforting the loved ones of the deceased who need some reassurance that they will go on, but not as that avatar as consciousness, as you said.",
  "Tom:: r in a different and more richer experience, something\nSpeaker2:: Tell me a little bit about the purpose of that database",
  "Tom:: And then there's just one little thread that runs through that, which is actually what did happen. \nTom:: So that past database is much more than just what did happen. \nTom:: It's everything that could have happened and the probability that it would have. \nTom:: So you have this database that's just left over as time goes on, but it's very, very valuable. \nTom:: And one of the ways it's valuable is so that the living can get the information, the knowledge, and often the consolation of the dead. \nTom:: That's one of the things that's used for it. \nTom:: And the people who help facilitate that are often called mediums, right? \nTom:: Mediums make the contact because they've learned how to get data out of that database. \nTom:: They've learned how to use their intent and make that connection. \nTom:: So it's a good thing if you are concerned that, you know, Aunt Susie or Uncle Fred who passed away that they're okay, you know, that everything worked right, the transition was fine and you worry about them. \nTom:: Well, you can contact them and they'll tell you, oh, yeah, everything's fine. \nTom:: We're doing great. \nTom:: And you can have conversations and they can help you raise your children. \nTom:: You can ask them questions and they can talk about current events. \nTom:: They can do everything that they would be able to do if they didn't die. \nTom:: Okay. \nTom:: So think of the entity that a medium contacts, your dead Aunt Susie Q. \nTom:: Think of that. \nTom:: Well, that entity that this medium is talking to is really the larger consciousness system, okay, producing a character just the way your Aunt Susie Q was. \nTom:: And it can do that because it has all that information. \nTom:: That database isn't just a sterile database of what Susie Q did. \nTom:: Like our histories are, oh, well, what did Winston Churchill do? \nTom:: Where was he born? \nTom:: You know, what year and what did he do? \nTom:: That's a very, that's a very sterile thing compared to this database. \nTom:: This database would be everything that Winston Churchill thought every emotion that he ever had, every idea that ever passed through hi",
  "Tom:: And it can do that because it has all that information.\nTom:: That database isn't just a sterile database of what Susie Q did.\nTom:: This database would be everything that Winston Churchill thought every emotion that he ever had, every idea that ever passed through his mind, not just what he did, but things he thought about he didn't do, you know, all of those things.\nTom:: So we have these databases and they're used for all sorts of things.\nSpeaker2:: Can you tell us a little bit about this is very in depth research and theory.",
  "Tom:: Well, when I first was able to control.\nTom:: And my first thought was that the past was still alive and interactive going on.\nTom:: It wasn't like reading a book like that kind of database where everything's very static.\nTom:: It was like it was alive. It was like a watching a movie of that people doing things. \nSpeaker2:: You can interact with them much more fully than you can through using a medium.",
  "Tom:: \"p was that that past was a live place because I could go there in that past and I could see people interacting.\" \nTom:: \"I could still see the Roman soldiers guarding the wall. I could see all kinds of things playing out people interaction stuff going on.\" \nTom:: \"So it wasn't like reading a book like that kind of database where everything's very static.\" \nTom:: \"It was like it was alive. It was like a watching a movie of that people doing things.\" \nTom:: \"I did experiments there to try to figure out how it worked.\" \nTom:: \"And one of the experiments I did that I think was probably the beginning of an aha moment for me in that was that I and a group of people and I think these were like family members, good friends.\" \nTom:: \"These were people I knew, but they were all together.\" \nTom:: \"And I was part of them.\" \nTom:: \"Now my avatar has let the consciousness go free, right?\" \nTom:: \"Because that's what going out of body is.\" \nTom:: \"You kind of let the avatar lies down and bestill and stops doing stuff.\" \nTom:: \"And the consciousness now is free to do things.\" \nTom:: \"So the consciousness goes down and connects with these people.\" \nTom:: \"And these people, this was historical.\" \nTom:: \"So these people existed.\" \nTom:: \"And I was with them in this movie, like I was talking about.\" \nTom:: \"And I decided, could I make a difference?\" \nTom:: \"If I could convince those people to do something differently than they did, would then I could I see a difference then in this world, you know, the butterfly effect kind of a thing.\" \nTom:: \"If I made this person, you know, if I made sure that Paul Revere never got on his horse and told the people the British were coming, you know, what difference would that make?\" \nTom:: \"You see, so I could intervene and see what what happened.\" \nTom:: \"Well, I tried those kinds of things.\" \nTom:: \"And of course, nothing happened.\" \nTom:: \"It didn't change what was going to go on here at all.\" \nTom:: \"The butterfly effect is just Hollywood.\" \nTom:: \"That's not the way it works.\" \nTom:: \"History isn't still going on.\"",
  "Tom:: If I made this person, you know, if I made sure that Paul Revere never got on his horse\nSpeaker not present\nTom:: And of course, nothing happened. It didn't change what was going to go on here\nat all.",
  "Tom:: So if I'd go into this place and say, Paul, you can't make that ride to tell everybody the readers are coming. You can't do that. And I knocked him down and I tied him up and, you know, tied his legs and hands behind his back and made him not do that. \nTom:: But see real people with free will aren't like that. People with free will, you can say the same thing to them. And they'll react differently because they have free will. They don't have to say the same thing. It's not deterministic. \nTom:: Eventually I realized that if I gave it the exact same input from the exact same situation, I didn't get different responses that you would if they had free will. It just didn't do that. It was, it did seem like determinism.",
  "Tom:: With that change in my intent, I'd get a totally different reaction from the people, just because my intent changed as to how I was carrying the database.\nTom:: So that's how I came to realize that, Oh, this is a database, but it's a database that is like being in a movie. It's not like looking in a book kind of database.\nTom:: There's a database of being there and interacting with people. And they interact with you.\nTom:: So that's was just part of the research I did and trying to understand how all this worked that let me realize that indeed, this was a very amazing database that had depth, you know, in depth information about people and could be queried, not only for what would be the most likely response, which is the highest probability of what they would say.\nSpeaker2:: The reason that you were able to do this is because you're also a man in depth consciousness explorer with repeated experiments in the kinds of things that you put into your book.",
  "Tom:: people don't understand.\nQuestioner:: Am I right to say that all of those things are from your own experience?\nTom:: The way I did that was in the 1970s, I started working with Bob Monroe.",
  "Tom:: Well, what model will answer all the facts, all the ones from consciousness, all the ones from the physical reality, what set of facts explain it all? And that's when I sat down to write my big toe, because I thought I had this idea of how to explain everything, not just the objective world and not just the subjective world, but a bigger understanding that overarch both of those. So it explained both the subjective and the objective world equally. So if you want to know why such such happens in the physical world, well, we call that physics, right? That's how that world works. And we have that as science. And if you want to know why you're upset because your ancestors died or why your life is such a struggle or why happiness and joy is not a main thing in your life, well, you can figure that out too. It's just as the same as doing that physics and figuring out how that physical world works. You can understand the science of the subjective world and see how that works as well. So there's science now on both sides of that as far as understanding why things are the way they are, how they work, you know, what do you have to do to make them better? So it's it's clear now in both the subjective and the objective world. There's a science that covers both of it. And that's basically what the my big toe is. So yes, it started from a set of objective facts and a set of subjective facts. And mostly there are no subjective facts for most people. But I created them through my own, what 35 years of research, I created those subjective facts just by trial and error and seeing what happened, what was connected to what, how does one thing affect another, which is the same way people figured it out in the physical world, right? It's the same, same process. That's how science is done. It's, you know, it's trial and error, and you've tried to figure out what affects other things and why. So yes, that's where it comes from. And the reason that there are a whole lot of people competing wit",
  "Tom:: ears of research,\nSpeaker2:: You wanted to know how reality worked. Well, I hope we have shed some light on this topic\nTom:: Oh, you're welcome. Well, you know, the good news is that your consciousness, you're not an avatar, your consciousness.",
  "Tom:: To learn and grow. And the more you learn and grow, the more you find a bigger picture and understanding that allows you to be happy and joyful and well connected and have good relationships and all of that stuff that everybody would like to have becomes easier and easier and more and more likely as you grow up, as you lower your entropy. So that's kind of the good news for people is that it's a very positive process.",
  "Tom:: There can be other people and other people and other relationships and more loved ones and more wonderful experiences helping each other grow up. You see, that's the thing. That's the positive thing going on. It's not like take a very limited Aunt Susie and make her deal with those limitations forever. You know, that wouldn't be very profitable, though it might in the end, after, you know, 10 or 20 times as much time, it still might work out, but it's just inefficient. It's not necessary. The system works very well the way it is, and it's kind of optimized the way it is.",
  "Tom:: and learn from those new situations.\nTom:: So it's, it's just not the effective way to run a consciousness system.\nTom:: The consciousness system is efficient and effective.\nTom:: And it's not heartless.\nTom:: It's not like, oh, that's so heartless, you have these avatars and then they just die and nothing happens after that.\nTom:: You're not an avatar.\nTom:: Stop identifying as an avatar, your consciousness and the whole system is made to help you succeed as consciousness, not to help you succeed as an avatar.\nTom:: Your consciousness and the system is optimized for you as consciousness.\nTom:: Even if you think it's a horrible system and you want to get out of it.\nTom:: That's just a very provincial, little local picture you have because of the struggles you're having with your fear and your ego and your beliefs.\nTom:: You'll get over that in time.\nTom:: Just persevere, you know, get some, somebody will patch you on the rump and send you back into the game, you know, just wipe off your tears and get back in there and play and you will and eventually you'll grow up and you'll see the beauty in the, in the system and how loving and caring the system is.\nTom:: Well I know you've experienced that beauty and you have, you're here to teach that to others and I thank you very much.\nSpeaker2:: Thank you very much for this time.",
