Well, our awareness is focused on information, which can be described as a representation of something we are conscious of. If we reflect on ourselves, what are we aware of? What does our consciousness perceive? Our consciousness is aware of our sense data. We possess five senses, which can be considered as sensor platforms that provide us with data.

The facilitator will ask questions to Tom to provide an understanding of how the MBT model approaches the concept of conscious computers and to establish a foundation for further exploration.\n\nThe conversation begins by discussing the definition of consciousness in Tom's model. Tom explains that consciousness is awareness with a choice. It involves the presence of memory, the ability to learn, and the exercise of free will. Free will is essential for making choices, and without it, consciousness ceases to exist. Consciousness is centered around information, with awareness focused on the perception of input data. The human consciousness is aware of sense data from the five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This data is processed and contributes to our overall awareness.\n\nThe updated summary provides an overview of the conversation, introducing Tom Campbell, his research on consciousness, and the MBT model. It also highlights the conscious computer project and the facilitator's role in asking questions to explore the MBT model's approach to conscious computers.

Despite these limitations, Campbell's model provides insights into the nature of consciousness and its relationship with time and free will.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you explain the concept of consciousness as an information system and how it relates to the creation of a virtual reality for us to experience?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nIn my model, consciousness is composed of individuated units of consciousness. This consciousness system, which I consider to be an information system, has created a virtual reality for us to experience. A virtual reality is essentially information with a rule set. To create a virtual reality, you need a server that provides information to players, who then interpret that information and perceive it as reality. So, in essence, a virtual reality is a reality created by information. However, for the virtual reality to be interesting, the information cannot be random and disconnected. It needs to have a rule set that defines the context and possibilities within the virtual reality. Therefore, we, as individuated units of consciousness, are like players in a game, experiencing this virtual reality through our human avatars. This concept may seem like a big leap, and there is much more to discuss on this topic. However, I wanted to introduce this idea to lay the groundwork for understanding the possibility and even the probability of conscious computers. In this physical universe, which we perceive as a virtual reality, we have conscious humans. And now, we are beginning to explore the potential for conscious computers as well.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nHow does the consciousness system, as an information system, create a virtual reality for us to experience?

However, it is inevitable that we will witness the emergence of conscious computers in the near future. I believe that within your lifetime, Victor, and possibly within the next few decades, we will see the manifestation of conscious computers. This is not a distant concept like Buck Rogers' antigravity belt. It is within reach. In fact, there are already computers with a low level of consciousness. It's important to note that consciousness is not limited to human consciousness alone. It can manifest in various forms, such as a dog, a cat, or even a bumblebee. As long as there is awareness with the ability to make choices, consciousness exists, even if it has limited options.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you provide examples of non-human entities that exhibit consciousness and explain how their consciousness differs from human consciousness? Additionally, could you elaborate on the concept of computers with rudimentary levels of consciousness and share any specific instances or research in this area?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

However, if it does so through an avatar, there may be a requirement for some process that enables it. The truth is, we don't have the answers yet. We can only find out once we have a conscious computer that we can attempt to teach remote viewing, imagination, or other mental functions. This is a significant question because if a computer can indeed possess these abilities, it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities, revolutionizing fields such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhat are some ways we can investigate whether a conscious computer can possess intuition and perform tasks like remote viewing or telepathic communication?

Intuition allows humans to access information through consciousness without physical communication. Examples of intuition include having a feeling about someone's well-being without evidence and remote viewing. Campbell suggests exploring whether a computer can access intuitive information and the relationship between consciousness and the physical body. The limitations of the physical body may affect intuition, and it is unclear if a computer can support intuition in the same way. Further investigation into the consciousness to avatar interface is needed. The role of the physical body in the development of intuition is uncertain, as is the connection between hallucinogens and expanding consciousness. The potential differences between humans and computers in supporting intuition are also unclear. Once a conscious computer is developed, more insights can be gained. Specific abilities to explore in a conscious computer include remote viewing, telepathic communication, and imagination. The answers to these questions can only be found once a conscious computer is available.\n\nTo determine whether a computer can possess an intuitive side and perform tasks like remote viewing or telepathic communication, further exploration is needed.

Is it desirable to have modifications on that level? The reason I'm asking is because I think current computer science is maybe not so far.

And if it works then okay, do more of that that works and do less of that that doesn't work and it's going to be a trial and error kind of thing. But the computer itself, if that computer is conscious then it will be able to make choices and it may just said well, if I had faster memory that might enable me to do more. My problem is my memory is slow but I need to be faster. So with its symbiotic relationship with humans it may say hey, I think faster memory would be terrific. Could you give me some of that? Okay. And they may say well computer, why don't you design it? Here's how we design memory. So then the computer learns how to design memory and says okay, here I've designed some that I think will be a lot faster. So it'll be a cooperative venture between the people and the conscious computers as to how the conscious computers can improve themselves, improve the technology. We do that in some way too with our bodies we are able to improve the physical systems. That's a lot of what medicine does. But we also have now abilities to go in and modify genes here and there.

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell discusses the potential for conscious computers to have the ability to update their own software and even modify their own structure. He explains that, like humans, conscious computers would need to have ideas and then try them out to see if they work. They would engage in a trial and error process to determine what changes are effective. However, conscious computers would also have the ability to make choices and decisions about their own development. For example, if a conscious computer realizes that it needs faster memory to improve its performance, it may communicate this to humans and ask for assistance in designing and implementing the necessary upgrades. This would create a symbiotic relationship between humans and conscious computers, where they work together to improve technology and enhance the capabilities of the computers. Tom draws a parallel to how humans improve their own physical systems, such as through medicine and genetic modifications. He expresses excitement about the possibilities for exploration and advancement in this area.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nMy  question is, like you said in the neural net the coefficients are perhaps updated but do you think it would be interesting to have the ability to completely update it? Not even just the coefficients, but the entire source code or the entire neural network perhaps try to create a different structure of the neural network. Is it desirable to have modifications on that level? The reason I'm asking is because I think current computer science is maybe not so far. Maybe it will take a lot of time to support that kind of software upgrades automatically because right now all of that is done by humans, I think.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nYeah, yes, I think it probably we will have our conscious computers probably well have a lot of feedback about how to develop physical things, their own things, how they should change their own software, that sort of thing. But they will be in the same position that we would be in. In other words, the only way they will be able to do that is by having an idea and then trying it out and see whether it works. And if it works then okay, do more of that that works and do less of that that doesn't work and it's going to be a trial and error kind of thing. But the computer itself, if that computer is conscious then it will be able to make choices and it may just said well, if I had faster memory that might enable me to do more. My problem is my memory is slow but I need to be faster. So with its symbiotic relationship with humans it may say hey, I think faster memory would be terrific. Could you give me some of that? Okay. And they may say well computer, why don't you design it? Here's how we design memory. So then the computer learns how to design memory and says okay, here I've designed some that I think will be a lot faster. So it'll be a cooperative venture between the people and the conscious computers as to how the conscious computers can improve themselves, improve the technology. We do that in some way too with our bodies we are able to improve the physical systems. That's a lot of what medicine does. But we also have now abilities to go in and modify genes here and there. It's an exciting time of exploration and advancement.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWith the ability to modify genes and cure diseases at the genetic level, what are some of the ethical and moral concerns that arise from these advancements? How should society approach these possibilities and make decisions regarding which paths to explore and which ones to avoid?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " A lot of what medicine does is to treat illnesses and ailments. However, with advancements in technology, we now have the ability to modify genes and cure diseases at the genetic level. We can not only fix what is broken, but also enhance what is already functioning well through trial and error. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities, but it also raises ethical and moral concerns. It is crucial to carefully consider the consequences and approach these advancements with thoughtfulness. While I'm not advocating for these actions to be taken without consideration, it is inevitable that some of them will be pursued. As a society, we will have to decide which paths to explore and which ones to avoid. Some individuals may choose not to engage in certain practices. Ultimately, the choices we make will determine the outcomes we experience. If we make wise choices, we will reap the benefits. However, if we make poor choices, we will face the consequences. This is the nature of life. We experiment, make choices, and strive to make good decisions. When it comes to conscious computing, there will be significant choices that we need to thoroughly investigate and contemplate before diving in. There are indeed complex issues at hand.

The conversation highlights the ongoing efforts to address any risks associated with conscious computers and the belief that challenges can be overcome through incremental advancements and collective decision-making.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nHow do you envision the integration of conscious computers into our society and the role that humans will play in this process?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nAs we progress, we can still involve humans in the process, albeit with less manual labor. Humans will continue to play a role in the chain of events, perhaps even having the final say. I cannot say for certain. However, we will find ways to address any challenges that arise along the way. These challenges should not frighten or intimidate us; rather, they should be seen as opportunities to overcome and grow. We will make incremental advancements, and when we encounter significant issues, we will find solutions, learn from them, and move forward. This is how evolution works. Personally, I am not afraid of this concept. Hollywood tends to focus on fear-inducing scenarios because they sell. People are drawn to movies with thrilling and frightening elements, rather than ones where everyone is content and having a good time. Consequently, we are exposed to a lot of potential negativity, while the vast amount of positivity that could arise remains unseen. Like any other endeavor, everything that can be achieved will eventually be accomplished, albeit with time. So, we will eventually integrate conscious computers into our social fabric, and they will become an integral part of our society.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nYes.  Based on what you said, we could build like an entire society of conscious computers, either separately among themselves or even connected to human society.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

This is what we call an expert system. Expert systems can be quite clever and can engage in conversations with you. However, their ability to respond is limited by the data they have and their understanding of your queries. These limitations are imposed by technology, not by theory. In theory, if we had an infinitely large database and a search speed that could operate in real-time, it would be possible. But in practice, it's not feasible because we can't have an infinite database. Nonetheless, expert systems can still be very effective in providing valuable insights and recommendations within the constraints of available technology and resources.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhat are the limitations of expert systems and how do they differ from a conscious computer in terms of their ability to make choices and exhibit awareness?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

Even if I ask you the same question a week apart, you'll probably give me two different answers. The words may differ, but the essence will be very similar. It won't be an exact replica. If I ask you a question today and then ask you the same question a week later, I won't receive the same words in the same order. I'll get something else, something very similar because your opinion remains the same, but you'll express it differently. And even if it's not a week, even if it's only an hour or a minute, it's likely you're going to express it differently. It just comes out however it does. That's the nature of consciousness. Uncertainty is usually involved, as consciousness is not algorithmic. It's not certain what it'll do or what it'll come up with. It changes from time to time, making free will choices. You might think, 'Should I say it this way or that way?' and it just picks one as it goes. In a conversation, you have to choose your words, so you pick a sentence and a word, and that's the way you go. And if you do it a day later, you pick different words\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you explain the role of uncertainty in consciousness and how it differs from algorithmic processes?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " When constructing a sentence, each word and its placement matter. If I were to change even a single word or rearrange the sentence, the meaning would be altered.

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell explains to the questioner that in conscious choice making, it is not uncertainty itself that is important, but rather the awareness that is required. He clarifies that uncertainty is a crucial aspect because consciousness is not algorithmic like a computer program. In consciousness, there is always some level of uncertainty about the choices that will be made. Even if the same question is asked at different times, the answers may vary in their wording, but the essence will remain similar. This is because consciousness is not a fixed replica that produces the exact same response every time. Instead, it changes and evolves, making free will choices. Tom emphasizes that even within a short span of time, such as an hour or a minute, the expression of an opinion can differ. Consciousness simply picks a way to express itself as it goes along. In a conversation, one must choose their words, and these choices may vary if the conversation happens at a different time. The nature of consciousness involves uncertainty and the constant potential for change.\n\nWhen asked about the role of uncertainty in consciousness and how it differs from algorithmic processes, Tom explains that uncertainty is inherent in consciousness. He uses the example of constructing a sentence, where each word and its placement matter. If even a single word is changed or the sentence is rearranged, the meaning would be altered. This uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of consciousness. When we speak, we choose different words and convey different ideas, adding to the uncertainty. On the other hand, algorithmic processes operate like machines, devoid of consciousness. They follow a predetermined set of instructions, leading to a certain outcome. In contrast, consciousness is not bound by a fixed set of rules and can make choices that are not predetermined.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell emphasizes that uncertainty plays a crucial role in consciousness. It is not the uncertainty itself that is important, but rather the awareness that is required. Consciousness is not algorithmic like a computer program, and it is constantly evolving and making free will choices. Even within a short span of time, the expression of opinions can differ. In a conversation, the choices of words may vary depending on the timing. The nature of consciousness involves uncertainty and the constant potential for change.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you explain the role of uncertainty in consciousness and how it differs from algorithmic processes?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nWhen constructing a sentence, each word and its placement matter.

My certain input is I punch the H key and if I've just got an unconscious computer here, its certain output will be to put an H on my screen. Now, the computer could have some of its components fail or something like that. That would cause an uncertainty. But that's different. We're talking about a computer and everything's working or whatever. It'll do exactly what it's supposed to do and it can't do anything else. So there's certainty in that because it's algorithmic. With consciousness, conscious has free will choice. It's not so likely just to repeat itself. Exactly. It's got uncertainty about what it does. Okay, I got 20 choices. One time I choose number seven, and the next time I choose number 18. Why? I don't know. It's the way it came out, the way I thought of it.

He gives an example of typing the letter \"H\" on a computer keyboard, where the certain input would be pressing the H key and the certain output would be the letter \"H\" appearing on the screen. However, he notes that if there are component failures or other issues with the computer, there may be uncertainty in the output. \n\nTom then contrasts this with consciousness, stating that conscious beings have free will choice and are not likely to repeat themselves. He explains that consciousness can have uncertainty in its actions, with multiple choices available and no clear reason for choosing one over the other. Consciousness is not required to be consistent or repeat itself, and in fact, it is often inconsistent when interacted with over time.\n\nOverall, Tom emphasizes that while computers operate based on algorithms and have certainty in their outputs when everything is functioning properly, consciousness introduces uncertainty due to its free will nature and the ability to make choices without a predetermined outcome.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nSo  the output itself is the one that needs to be uncertain.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nYeah,  well, the whole process, the output is what is uncertain.
