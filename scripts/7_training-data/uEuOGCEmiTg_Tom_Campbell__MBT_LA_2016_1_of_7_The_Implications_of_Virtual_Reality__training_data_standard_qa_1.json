Over the years, I have had the pleasure of having a diverse audience attend my talks. I've had the privilege of engaging with individuals as young as 13, although they are quite rare. Typically, the majority of the audience falls within the age range of 30 to 65. It seems that the younger generation is preoccupied with various pressing matters in their lives, understandably so. However, having you here, Ellie, brings a smile to my face and fills me with gratitude for your presence and the wonderful introduction you delivered. Thank you immensely. Now, let me express my gratitude to the individuals who have played a crucial role in making this event possible. At the bottom of my list, but certainly not in terms of importance, is Dogda McCulgan. She not only envisioned this event but also worked tirelessly to bring it to fruition, overcoming numerous obstacles along the way. I am truly grateful for Dogda's dedication and effort. I would also like to extend my appreciation to Alex Peterson, James Joyce, Justin Snodgrass, Marla Freeze, and Donna Aveni, all of whom have invested their time and energy into ensuring the success of this event. Without their contributions, we would not be here today. Now, let's dive into the topic at hand. I have titled this talk 'Reality 102.' You may wonder why 102? Well, the reason is simple. I previously gave a talk titled 'Reality 101,' and this is the next step in our exploration of the nature of reality.

Today's talk is going to be a bit different from my usual workshops. Normally, I start from the beginning and explain the fundamentals of reality and why it functions the way it does. If you've watched my previous workshops, like the one in Calgary or the one in Marseille which is available on YouTube, you'll find a detailed explanation of the theory of MBT (My Big TOE). However, today I have something else in store for you. I won't be starting from the beginning and deriving everything step by step. Instead, I'll be starting somewhere in the middle. I won't go into all the details because I've covered them extensively in the past. The information is out there and accessible. So, if you're wondering how I arrived at certain points, rest assured that there is logical reasoning behind them. You can find the explanations elsewhere, just not in today's talk. However, feel free to ask any questions you may have later today or tomorrow if you're unsure about how I connected point A to point B. We'll have plenty of time for Q&A tomorrow. Depending on how quickly I can go through the slides, we have about 60 of them to cover today, we may have some time for additional questions towards the end of the session.\n###"

Now, let me give you a brief background about myself. I'm a physicist who had the privilege of meeting Bob Monroe when I was in my late 20s. Bob was searching for scientists to join his lab, and since I was a scientist, I volunteered. Our agreement was simple: he would teach me what he knew, which included his expertise in out-of-body experiences and his three books: 'Journeys Out of the Body,' 'Far Journeys,' and 'Ultimate Journey.' Under his guidance, I learned how to explore the larger consciousness system and navigate it with complete control. As a physicist, my primary goal is to understand how reality functions. Flying around in the larger reality posed a significant challenge for me. I questioned the limits, possibilities, and the very nature of consciousness itself. These were complex inquiries, and it took me around 30 to 35 years to compile my findings into the books I wrote. Throughout this journey, my connection with Monroe lasted for about a decade, with five years of intense activity and several years serving on the board of directors. However, my passion for this subject never waned. Once you embark on this path, as many of you may have experienced, it becomes impossible to turn back.

Without evolution, randomness prevails, and in the realm of information systems, that equates to a lack of meaningful information. It's akin to death, a state of dissolution. Therefore, this system, being a natural and conscious entity, has an inherent drive to survive and evolve. It possesses intelligence and consciousness, and its path to evolution lies in the reduction of entropy.

        "completion": " When I realized that I understood the key thing from a consciousness viewpoint, I started exploring other aspects. It didn't take long for me to realize that consciousness also provided an explanation for why the speed of light, denoted as 'c', is a constant. This was another enigma in the realm of science. As I delved deeper, I discovered that the field of science, particularly physics, is riddled with paradoxes and unexplained phenomena. Despite having experimental data, scientists often find themselves puzzled by the 'whys' behind these observations. However, consciousness seemed to offer a solution to these paradoxes, one after another. The latest addition to this list was chaos theory. I came across a book on chaos, where the author mentioned that scientists and science historians believed that the 20th century would be defined by three major scientific achievements: quantum mechanics, relativity, and chaos. With consciousness already explaining quantum mechanics and relativity through the constant speed of light, I pondered over chaos. And indeed, consciousness also shed light on the rationality behind the chaotic nature of our reality. I will touch upon this towards the end of my talk, explaining why our reality is characterized by chaos. By chaos, I don't mean the disorder you witness on the streets, but rather the concept of 'p' that represents the inherent unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions in complex systems.\n###"

He also discovered that within this reality, consciousness manifests as individual units, and evolution is necessary to reduce entropy and bring meaningful information. The system has an inherent drive to survive and evolve, and cooperation and care for one another are essential for achieving the lowest entropy state.\n\nIn response to a question about the relationship between consciousness and the physical world, Tom explains that he understood the key to understanding consciousness lies in the fundamental principle of cooperation and compassion. He believes that the point of our existence is to care about each other and cultivate love, which is a profound message that he felt compelled to convey. Interestingly, it took him a couple of years to realize the profound impact that a deep understanding of physics would have on our understanding of consciousness. He published books exploring consciousness in 2003 and later made the connection between the principles that explain consciousness and those that explain physics. He discovered that his probabilistic model of consciousness perfectly explained quantum mechanics and the perplexing phenomenon of the double-slit experiment. This realization highlighted the profound interconnectedness between consciousness and the physical world.\n\nIn summary, Tom expresses gratitude, introduces the topic of his talk, explains that it will be different from his previous workshops, and shares some background on his journey as a physicist and exploration of the larger consciousness system and the nature of reality. He assures the audience that there is logical reasoning behind his points and encourages them to ask questions during the Q&A session. He also discusses the relationship between consciousness and the virtual construct of reality, as well as the role of entropy reduction in the evolution of consciousness within this system. Additionally, he explains the profound impact that a deep understanding of physics has had on his understanding of consciousness and its connection to the physical world.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nIn your exploration of the larger consciousness system and the nature of reality, what insights did you gain about the relationship between consciousness and the physical world? How did your understanding of consciousness help you make connections to principles in physics?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nWhen I realized that I understood the key thing from a consciousness viewpoint, I started exploring other aspects. It didn't take long for me to realize that consciousness also provided an explanation for why the speed of light, denoted as 'c', is a constant. This was another enigma in the realm of science. As I delved deeper, I discovered that the field of science, particularly physics, is riddled with paradoxes and unexplained phenomena. Despite having experimental data, scientists often find themselves puzzled by the 'whys' behind these observations. However, consciousness seemed to offer a solution to these paradoxes, one after another. The latest addition to this list was chaos theory. I came across a book on chaos, where the author mentioned that scientists and science historians believed that the 20th century would be defined by three major scientific achievements: quantum mechanics, relativity, and chaos. With consciousness already explaining quantum mechanics and relativity through the constant speed of light, I pondered over chaos. And indeed, consciousness also shed light on the rationality behind the chaotic nature of our reality. I will touch upon this towards the end of my talk, explaining why our reality is characterized by chaos. By chaos, I don't mean the disorder you witness on the streets, but rather the concept of 'p' that represents the inherent unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions in complex systems.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you explain the concept of chaos in the context of physics and how it relates to the nature of reality? How did your understanding of consciousness help you make connections to chaos theory and its implications for our understanding of the unpredictable nature of our reality?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

We find that many natural systems become naturally chaotic when pushed into unstable areas. This concept gained traction in the 1990s, although the original work can be traced back to the 70s. It was a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of reality. Fundamentally, reality is chaotic and not as predictable as we once believed. Today, I want to discuss how I came to the realization that virtual reality is the key to delivering the message of love to a larger population. Once I understood that our reality is virtual and information-based, everything fell into place. Virtual reality is the crux of it all, and we will delve into this topic extensively. Interestingly, scientists have struggled to grasp this concept. Nearly a century ago, in the early 1920s, they conducted an experiment that revealed the non-materialistic and probabilistic nature of reality. This experiment also highlighted the role of consciousness, as certain phenomena only occurred when an observer was present. Despite having this information, scientists were unsure how to interpret and utilize it, leading to ongoing debates and further exploration in the field of quantum mechanics.\n###"

You know, a miracle is something that defies explanation, something that shouldn't happen. And that's exactly what the double slit experiment was - a phenomenon that defied all expectations. Let me explain further. When particles are fired one at a time at two holes in a background, you would expect them to pile up behind each hole, right? Well, that's not what happens. Instead, these particles distribute themselves in a wave pattern, creating what is known as a diffraction pattern. It's truly remarkable! They go through one hole and then find a spot on the screen to hit. It's like they have a mind of their own. And that, my friend, is what I consider a minor miracle. It's something that cannot be easily explained. The particles are so tiny that scientists couldn't fully comprehend the mechanism behind it. They simply brushed it off as 'weird science'.

I've been pondering how the larger consciousness system would manage this reality, how it would implement it, and how it would function. One of the last major ideas I had was during a workshop I conducted in Costa Mesa, Southern California, about eight years ago. During a conversation with my son, who attended the workshop, he raised an interesting point.

However, it didn't really have a significant impact, except for some minor changes. That's where we stand. These physics experiments, hopefully, will be miraculous enough to capture the attention of scientists, prove them wrong, and motivate them to conduct these experiments to demonstrate that it actually works that way. So, what I've done is taken the concept of virtual reality and applied it to our reality, exploring how our reality is created from this virtual reality and how it relates to quantum mechanics. I've been pondering how the larger consciousness system would manage this reality, how it would implement it, and how it would function. One of the last major ideas I had was during a workshop I conducted in Costa Mesa, Southern California, about eight years ago. During a conversation with my son, who attended the workshop, he raised an interesting point. He suggested that it would be better if the most likely outcome was chosen randomly, rather than based on probability. And you know what? He was right\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhat led you to consider the need for a more defined structure in the operation of this reality, and how does this understanding drive the experiments you are conducting?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " When I was discussing likelihoods with someone, they suggested that it would be better if the outcomes were random. I agreed with them, as that was the essence of what I was trying to convey. However, due to the nature of randomness, the most likely outcomes tend to prevail most of the time. This made me contemplate the need for a more defined structure. From that point onwards, my understanding of the mechanism behind the operation of this reality accelerated rapidly. It is this understanding that will drive the experiments we are conducting. Although these experiments are still in progress, we cannot predict their outcomes yet. They are based on my concept of virtual reality and its functioning. Whether my concept turns out to be correct or not, it does not invalidate the ideas about consciousness and love being the answer. It would simply mean that my understanding of how this virtual reality implements the mechanics of our reality was flawed. Today, we are embarking on this journey to potentially revolutionize the scientific understanding of virtuality and consciousness. For those of you who are more inclined towards holistic thinking and the bigger picture, I apologize in advance. Today's discussion will primarily focus on technical aspects and delve into a deeper level of understanding.\n###"

The slides may appear crowded, but don't worry, you don't have to read every word. I will provide you with all the necessary information. The slides are primarily designed for those who will watch this presentation on a DVD or on YouTube, allowing them to read the content at their own pace. That's why I've included more text on the slides, as these individuals can pause, rewind, and review the information as needed.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you provide a detailed explanation of the concept of emergent complexity and how it relates to the evolution of the larger consciousness system? How does the assumption of prime mortal consciousness play a role in this conjecture?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

The slides need to contain all the necessary information. They will be quite different from the typical slides you usually see, as they will have a lot more content. Let's start with some background information. We begin with the assumption that prime mortal consciousness exists. Over time, it has evolved into what it is today and continues to evolve. This assumption leads us to the conjecture that the larger consciousness system evolves through emergent complexity, which operates on simple, initially random recursive processes. I won't delve too much into this topic as I have discussed it before. The concept of emergent complexity suggests that if a random system has the potential to be more than just random, it will eventually actualize that potential given enough time. Many combinations of elements will occur, leading to the emergence of non-random patterns. If these patterns are stable, they can serve as a foundation for further development. Cellular automata is a concept that exemplifies this idea. It involves a simple process, often just a few lines of code, that is repeated over and over again, generating complex and intricate patterns that can be studied and analyzed.\n###"

Every virtual reality, whether it's in the sims or a flight simulator, shares these fundamental attributes. In flight training, pilots learn how to fly planes on computers before they actually get into the real thing. It's a virtual reality. All virtual realities have three interacting components: a computer, a player, and the computation of the virtuality itself. The computer serves as the rule set, while the player is the one interacting with the virtual world. The computation of the virtuality is the result. The player and the computer engage in a constant dialogue. For example, when the player types in the command for their Elf to stand up, the computer changes the pixels on their screen accordingly. If there are any consequences to that action, the computer computes them as well.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhen interacting with a virtual reality environment, how does the computer calculate the consequences of the player's actions and provide feedback to the player?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " As I look at it, I see an Elf standing up. And if that action has any consequences, I compute those as well. For instance, when the Elf stands up, he may bump his head on something above him. I take into account all the consequences of that action. The Elf's perspective is interesting because, to him, the computer has to be nonphysical. In his world, what's physical is the World of Warcraft map. That's what he interacts with. If he runs into a brick wall or falls off a cliff, it hurts. He can place objects on tables, and they stay there without falling through. Although it's a virtual table and a virtual Elf, it behaves as if it were solid. The Elf can even bang his fist on it, just like we can here. This behavior is determined by the rule set. So when the player instructs the Elf to stand up, the computer calculates all the consequences and sends the data back to the player's screen. The player can then react to those consequences and provide further instructions. It's essentially a conversation between the player and the computer.\n###"

Finally, Tom suggests exploring the computer game No Man's Sky to gain a better understanding of the probability distribution and how it relates to the representation of reality in virtual environments.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you provide an example of a real-world scenario where the probabilistic nature of virtual reality becomes more prominent and how it relates to the deterministic calculations that underlie the virtual environment?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nWhen I read about No Man's Sky and how they do it, the description sounds a lot like what I just told you. Everything is computed on the fly, nothing is saved in memory. The computer doesn't need to save a picture of the door, it calculates everything in real-time. The virtual reality aspect of it is predominantly probabilistic, and I can demonstrate that. It starts off mostly deterministic, but gradually becomes more probabilistic. The deterministic part is responsible for calculating the distributions for the probability part. Let me give you an example using a cannon. A cannon is a simple machine, just a piece of metal with a hole in it. You put powder in the back, roll a ball in, light it, and pressure builds up behind the ball, propelling it forward. If we were to describe the cannon shooting deterministically, we would have to start at the molecular or even atomic level. There are so many variables involved, such as how the powder burns, how it's packed, its density, the presence of air, and the amount of oxygen. It's a complex process.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nIn the context of firing a cannonball, can you explain the role of probability in accurately computing its trajectory and how it helps in describing and predicting the outcome?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " When it comes to firing a cannonball, there are numerous factors to consider. The density of the cannonball, its packing, the distribution of air inside the cannon, and the amount of oxygen present all play a role in the process. It's a highly intricate and complex process. Even at the molecular level, solving the problem of firing a single cannonball would require months of computation on a supercomputer. This is because the cannonball is not perfectly round, and the barrel is not a perfect cylinder. As the cannonball is propelled out of the barrel, the barrel itself warps and flexes due to the elasticity of the metal and the heat generated. The dimensions of the barrel and the cannonball change as a result. This is just one example of the intricate nature of reality, where everything from quarks to cannonballs needs to be taken into account. Starting at the simplest level is crucial, as molecules are composed of atoms, atoms are composed of smaller particles, and so on. It's a bottom-up approach that allows for a comprehensive understanding. However, even with this approach, accurately and precisely computing the trajectory of a cannonball is an incredibly challenging task. Physicists would likely struggle to achieve high levels of accuracy beyond the 7th or 8th decimal place. Therefore, probability becomes a useful tool in describing and predicting such phenomena. For instance, when I fire the cannon, the ball is likely to go out in a random direction within a certain range of angles and distances.\n###"

Even if you were to fire the cannon 100 times, the ball would never land in the same place twice. It's just the nature of the beast. Now, how do we describe this randomness? Well, we use something called a probability distribution. It's like a map of all the possible places the ball could land.

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell's talk, \"Reality 102,\" delves into the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness. He emphasizes the importance of involving physicists in the mainstream adoption of virtual reality and plans to present three major experiments challenging materialism. One key aspect discussed by Tom is the concept of fractals and how they can shed light on the functioning of our world and the emergence of consciousness.\n\nAccording to Tom, consciousness is an information system that processes data, is aware, and perceives. Its purpose is to contribute to the overall system by reducing entropy. The virtual reality simulation serves as a training ground for entropy reduction.\n\nTom explains that the big bang was a simulation, not a physical event, and the simulation evolved based on a rule set. In virtual reality environments, the computer, the player, and the computation of the virtuality interact to create the virtual world.\n\nTom addresses the role of probability in accurately computing the trajectory of a cannonball. He explains that firing a cannonball involves numerous factors, making it highly intricate and complex. Probability becomes a useful tool in describing and predicting such phenomena.\n\nHe provides an example of the computer game No Man's Sky, where everything is computed on the fly. The virtual reality aspect of the game is predominantly probabilistic, with the deterministic part responsible for calculating the distributions for the probability part.\n\nTom also explores the concept of spin in quantum mechanics and its relation to the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena. Spin is not a physical spinning motion but rather a metaphor for something nonphysical. This randomness in spin measurements is due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn response to a question about continuously measuring a particle's spin in quantum mechanics, Tom explains that by continuously measuring it every ten seconds, even after an hour, it will remain in the same state without decaying. The reason it doesn't decay is that each time it is measured, there hasn't been enough time for decay to occur. The probability of it being in other states is almost zero because only 10 seconds have passed since the last measurement. Therefore, the probability of it being in the same state is almost one. This continuous measurement resets the clock and prevents decay.\n\nTom also discusses the relationship between continuously measuring a particle's spin and the concept of entanglement. He explains that the act of measurement can actually prevent the decay of a particle. This phenomenon is related to entanglement, where flipping a spin state in one location causes an instantaneous flip in the opposite spin state in another location.\n\nIn conclusion, Tom Campbell's talk explores the nature of reality as a virtual construct driven by consciousness. He emphasizes the importance of involving physicists in the mainstream adoption of virtual reality and plans to present three major experiments challenging materialism. He also highlights the need for a fundamental theory to explain phenomena observed in virtual reality and consciousness research. Tom explains fractals and their role in the emergence of complexity and beauty in our world. He also provides insights into how consciousness became self-aware and the driving force behind it, emphasizing the reduction of entropy as its purpose and existence. Additionally, Tom explains the initial conditions and rule set that governed the evolution of the virtual reality simulation, starting from the big bang. The conversation also explores how the computer calculates the consequences of the player's actions and provides feedback in a virtual reality environment. Furthermore, Tom suggests exploring the computer game No Man's Sky to gain a better understanding of the probability distribution and how it relates to the representation of reality in virtual environments. Lastly, Tom discusses the role of probability in accurately computing the trajectory of a cannonball and how it helps in describing and predicting the outcome.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nHow does the act of continuously measuring a particle's spin prevent it from decaying into other states and what is the relationship between this phenomenon and the concept of entanglement?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nIn terms of distribution, whenever you measure it, you will always get the same answer.

Physics doesn't know a thing about the origin, about the causality of all the things that are most fundamental to physics.

It's not particularly flattering to admit that we don't know something, so we resort to fabricating explanations. We attribute phenomena to electrons, quarks, and other made-up entities, which makes us appear knowledgeable and intelligent. However, the crux of the issue lies in our tendency to believe these fabrications as absolute truth. This is a problem that scientists grapple with as well. It's fascinating to consider that scientists have embraced materialism as a necessary belief system, at least until our knowledge and understanding expand enough to provide a more comprehensive and accurate explanation of how the world truly operates. Materialism, in essence, is a transitional phase that we are currently navigating. It serves as a temporary framework until we can uncover a grander perspective on reality.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhy did scientists embrace materialism as a necessary belief system, and how did it contribute to their authority over religion?

In every virtual reality, there is a maximum speed at which things can move. It's like one pixel or one chunk of volume per one unit of time. Each time you go through a time loop, you can move one spot. If you jump spots within one time loop, you're essentially teleporting. And that's when things start to get really strange. If you want a reality that makes sense, you need to carefully navigate the time loops and avoid any sudden jumps or teleportations.\n###"

But here's the catch: these values are digital and can only change in small increments. Once you make those changes, it becomes impossible to align them exactly as they were before. This means that even if we measure the speed of light with great precision, say up to 1820 decimal places, we won't be able to align them perfectly. This discrepancy arises because we can't precisely reduce them by the exact amounts needed to maintain a constant ratio. As we strive for more resolution, these small deviations start to appear. I haven't examined this phenomenon closely, but I predict that these slight variations in the speed of light occur just before we delve deeper into the resolution of our physical reality. They represent the challenges of keeping the ratio the same while being unable to maintain it exactly due to the digital nature of these values. You see, in the digital world, things can only move by whole chunks, not fractions or partial chunks.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nIn the realm of physics, what challenges arise when we strive for higher resolution without altering the speed of light, and how do these challenges relate to the digital nature of values in our physical reality?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell's talk, \"Reality 102,\" explores the idea that reality is a virtual construct influenced by consciousness. He believes that physicists should play a role in the acceptance of virtual reality and presents experiments that challenge materialism. Tom discusses the concept of space in a simulation, explaining that it is defined by an origin and three-dimensional coordinates. He also explains how time is generated in a simulation and discusses the role of mass, charge, and gravitation as models created to explain observed effects. Tom suggests that the speed of light acts as a speed limit in our universe, which could indicate that we are living in a virtual reality. He also argues that fields, such as electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields, are mathematical abstractions that help maintain our belief in materialism. Tom mentions recent scientific discoveries, such as the detection of gravitational waves and variability in the speed of light, which challenge our understanding of the universe. In the context of virtual reality, physicists do not have a definitive answer to these phenomena.\n\nDuring the conversation, Tom is asked about increasing resolution in the realm of physics without altering the speed of light. He explains that the speed of light, denoted as Delta T one Delta X one Delta T, is a crucial factor in many aspects. To increase resolution without altering the speed of light, Tom suggests dividing both the numerator, Delta X, and the denominator, Delta T, by a million. This maintains the same ratio while achieving higher resolution. However, he points out that these values are digital and can only change in small increments. As a result, it becomes impossible to align them exactly as they were before, leading to small deviations. Tom predicts that these slight variations in the speed of light occur just before delving deeper into the resolution of our physical reality. He attributes these challenges to the digital nature of the values in our physical reality, where things can only move by whole chunks, not fractions or partial chunks.\n\nIn response to the question about challenges in increasing resolution without altering the speed of light, Tom explains that the digital nature of values in our physical reality poses limitations. He emphasizes that values in our reality can only change in small increments, moving by whole units rather than fractions or decimals. This means that when attempting to increase resolution, it becomes impossible to align the values exactly as they were before, resulting in small deviations. Tom suggests that these deviations in the speed of light occur just before reaching deeper levels of resolution in our physical reality. He connects these challenges to the concept of initial conditions in a virtual reality, where the existence of chaos and unanswerable questions indicates a virtual nature. Tom also mentions the peculiar phenomena of quantum mechanics and the double-slit experiment as signatures of a virtual reality.\n\nOverall, Tom's talk highlights the nature of reality as a virtual construct influenced by consciousness and the potential implications of virtual reality simulations. He also addresses the challenges of increasing resolution in physics without altering the speed of light, emphasizing the digital nature of values in our physical reality and the connection to initial conditions in a virtual reality.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nIn the realm of physics, what challenges arise when we strive for higher resolution without altering the speed of light, and how do these challenges relate to the digital nature of values in our physical reality?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nThey can't move by fractions or decimals.

        "completion": " In my view, the presence of odd phenomena and the lack of understanding regarding the origins of mass, time, and space are indicative of a virtual reality.
