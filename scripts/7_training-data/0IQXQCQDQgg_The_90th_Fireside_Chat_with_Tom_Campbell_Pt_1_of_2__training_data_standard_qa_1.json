Well, I will ask Dorothea to be a little more specific in the situation because that's such a broad question, it's hard to answer it. I  can understand it. I'll try to describe a little bit better with some examples. Around 1947, a man named Mirin Dajo attracted worldwide attention with a demonstration of how he pierced the fluorette through his body without being seriously injured. According to him, he was absolutely convinced that he could not be hurt. This was his explanation why he wasn't hurt.

However, there is uncertainty about the exact impact on his organs since there are no x-rays to confirm. Eventually, he pushed his abilities too far and swallowed something that cracked his certainty, leading to potential harm. Campbell highlights that it was his own decision to push the boundaries, not the system's. The system, however, may have played a role in opening people's minds to what is possible.\n\nIn summary, the conversation explores the rule set of virtual reality and its flexibility. Changes in virtual reality are made by modifying future probabilities, with intent playing a crucial role. The LCS has the ability to override the rule set and produce any desired outcome, including the regeneration of body parts. The LCS interacts with individuals to expand their perspectives and show them the possibilities beyond the material world. Campbell also shares a personal story about his own ability to focus and manipulate outcomes, highlighting the role of intent and uncertainty in such abilities.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you share a story or example of someone who had a remarkable ability to focus and manipulate outcomes, particularly in situations where they performed daring acts without getting hurt?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nWell, let me tell you about this guy I know named Tom Campbell. He was quite something. He had an incredible ability to focus and a strong intention to not get hurt. It's fascinating to think about what actually happened inside his body when he performed those daring acts. Unfortunately, we don't have any x-rays to see the exact impact on his organs. However, his intention to avoid harm likely reduced the probability of a fatal injury. Perhaps the object he swallowed, like a dagger or a knife, managed to navigate its way through his intestines without causing any major damage. It's hard to say for sure. Uncertainty played a significant role in his ability to manipulate the outcome. But, you know, there's always a limit to what one can handle. Eventually, he pushed it too far and swallowed something that cracked his certainty. Maybe he started to worry that this time it would actually hurt him. Or perhaps he simply reached a point where he had proven his point and should have stopped. It's possible that his decision to keep pushing the boundaries was a poor choice. But in the end, it was him, not the system, who made that decision. The system, on the other hand, may have played a role in opening people's minds to what is possible, ultimately contributing to the progress and innovation that followed.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you provide an example of a rare occurrence where individuals with stage four cancer miraculously become cancer-free within a short period of time, defying the initial prognosis?

Astonishingly, after just one week, they miraculously find themselves cancer-free. Now, I won't say it happens frequently, but it's not uncommon to hear about such cases occurring once or twice a year in major cities. It's truly mind-boggling how the human body, with all its uncertainties, can defy the odds like that.

Many people I know have successfully used music to complement their activities and achieve better results. When it comes to mixing different elements, such as reducing distractions, music can play a significant role. By finding the right balance and adjusting the volume or tempo, you can create an environment that supports your goals and helps you stay on track.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nTwo  tones that creating the binary beats, if you lower it to really lower the master of it, do you think that it will be also useful for staying in a meditative state?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

Will it put you in that state and lock you there as strongly? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that you're making this cooperation between the music and the binaural beat and to put the binaural beat in to where it's almost subliminal, where you can't really hear it, it's just in there, but it's just there that if you know about and think about it, you can hear it, but otherwise you wouldn't notice it. It'll still do its thing, it'll still create brain entrainment to theta state just the same but it won't necessarily do it as strongly if that was the only thing you were listening to. So it'll still have its effect. It may not be as strong effect or as immediate effect but it'll still work. Doesn't have to be loud or dominant but its effect will probably be more subtle. The effect won't be the sledgehammer effect, it'll be a more subtle effect. Now Guillaume, you had another question. Would you like to ask that as well while we're on you?\n###"

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell explains to Guillaume that it is not necessary to keep the binaural beat loud in the mix. He suggests that making it subtle can still work effectively. The purpose is to create a cooperation between the music and the binaural beat. By making the binaural beat almost subliminal, where it is just present but not easily noticeable, it can still create brain entrainment to the theta state. However, the effect may not be as strong or immediate as if it were the dominant sound. It will have a more subtle effect rather than a sledgehammer effect.

Would you like to ask that as well while we're on you?\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nYeah,  sure. Quite simple question. You talk a bit with Caroline about the negative towards self. So my question is about that. I've been through a lot of negative self talk those last years and I'm kind of tired of it, of listening to that old tape and not feeling good about myself sometime. And I want to ask is that negative self talk kind of useful? Is there a way to reduce considerably this flow of shitty self talk? I kind of think that the more you meditate the more you are aware of that kind of stream. And I just want to finish with saying sometimes I feel like I can't afford the luxury of a negative tough in the pursuit of happiness and lowering the entropy of my consciousness.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " Well, I believe that having negative thoughts is a luxury we can't afford. There is absolutely nothing good about it, no advantage to be gained, and it never brings any good. It's always negative, and that's the most self-defeating thing one can do - constantly putting oneself down and entertaining negative thoughts. Thoughts like 'I'm not good enough,' 'I don't know enough,' 'I'm not smart enough,' 'I'm not fast enough,' 'I'm not strong enough,' 'I'm not whatever.' The list can go on and on, and if you focus on these thoughts, they will hold you down. It's like trying to swim with a cement block fastened to your back - it just makes everything else difficult. So, in my opinion, the worst thing you can do is to have a negative stream of thoughts about what you're doing and how you're doing it. However, it doesn't mean that you should never take a serious look at yourself. Sometimes, there might be negative aspects that need addressing, but you shouldn't keep iterating on them endlessly. Instead, you can look at yourself and say, 'Okay, if I want a better job, I probably need to go to school and learn some new skills.' Then, you can make a plan and take action. So, it's not that you can't be critical of yourself and come up with a plan, but it's important not to get stuck in a loop of self-doubt and self-pity. Just saying, 'I can't seem to get a job that pays enough, it's so unfair, and I can't seem to do it. I've been trying and trying, and nothing works. I guess I'm just not good enough to get promoted.' It's a never-ending cycle that leads nowhere, preventing personal growth and hindering the ability to overcome challenges and achieve success.\n###"
