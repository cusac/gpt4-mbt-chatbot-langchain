But if we give it like a computer programming language, that might not sound very human, but on the other hand, it might be much easier for the computer to understand and at least for specific humans who can deal with the language, they might be able to communicate in very logical ways. Just thinking of this as a shortcut.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nYeah,  that's possible. You might make some shortcuts like that. Teach it a very rudimentary language. It doesn't have a lot of vocabulary. Maybe it has like 200 nouns and 300 adjectives or something like that and that's all you got and you have to work with that. You could limit it to things like that. But if you just gave it its own language that only it could understand, you wouldn't have any idea what you had. You wouldn't know whether it was evolved or not evolved or deevolving. In order for the human to interact with it, it has to be able to speak to humans and the natural most natural way for it to speak to humans is with a voice. The input that's natural would be listening with ears or receiving type, receiving text. So if it's going to interact with humans, then it needs to speak human needs to speak a human language of some sort. Otherwise you never know what's going on we talked about. You need to understand what's going on and how it's growing and you don't want it to develop fears and all this other thing. And if it's off doing its own thing and no human can understand it, well, who knows what it's doing?\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nSo  the only problem or concern I have with that is that it might end up a little bit ambiguous. Like human language itself is somewhat ambiguous and depend up to interpretation. And so it might make it a bit difficult for us to understand what it's really thinking. It might look like this, it might look like that. Like all these legal texts you can interpret this way and that way exactly.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

And then you ask them another question, like, 'But what about this other thing?' And after half an hour, you probably understand what they're trying to say. But conversations don't work like everyone talking perfectly logically and the other person interpreting it perfectly. I think people have to learn language because language is imprecise. They have to be able to express their thoughts in different ways and expand on their ideas. That's all part of it. English, in particular, is a language that heavily relies on context. The same sound can mean five different things, and the same spelling can mean three different things. For example, 'tear' can mean both 'a drop of water from the eye' and 'to rip something apart.' They're spelled exactly the same. So context is very important in English. Unlike Spanish, where there are all kinds of little connecting words, English leaves out those details and expects people to understand from the context.

In contrast to Spanish, which includes more connecting words, English relies heavily on context for understanding.\n\nIn response to a question about the evolution of the English language and its flexibility, Tom explains that English is relatively simple compared to other languages. Unlike Latin, German, and other Romance languages, English does not have gender issues where every noun has a gender. English is constantly changing, and there is no committee in the US that dictates what is proper or not. People are free to say whatever they want in any way they want, as long as it is understandable. This allows the language to evolve naturally without much interference. Slang emerges, new words are invented, and if they become popular, they end up in the dictionary. Conversely, old words that are no longer used fade away. The flexibility of English also stems from the fact that there are often multiple ways to express the same thing, providing a wide range of possibilities for self-expression.\n\nOverall, the conversation emphasizes the inherent ambiguity of language and the importance of context in understanding.

Tom predicts that once a more advanced version of conversational AI is developed, the market will truly flourish.\n\nIn terms of studying conscious computers, Tom suggests that the first step is to automate tasks and find interesting activities for them to engage in. He proposes managing the electrical grid as one such task, as it involves making ethical decisions to maintain a balanced system. Currently, researchers are exploring the possibilities of making computers perform simple tasks that require quick thinking, fast action, and rapid decision-making. This research could potentially lead to the development of conscious computers.\n\nTom mentions the language computer created by Google, which he listened to and found its responses to be reasonable. He highlights that this type of computer is more like humans because it engages in activities such as interacting with people on the web. The future of conscious computers will depend on the tasks assigned to them and the capabilities developed.\n\nTom emphasizes the importance of market demand in determining the direction of market opportunities for conversational AI that can understand and speak human language. He explains that following the money is crucial, as without market demand, there won't be any development. He suggests that if there is a significant demand for conversational conscious computers, where people are looking for companionship and genuine understanding rather than just interacting with a machine like Alexa, then that could be a fascinating avenue to explore.\n\nOverall, Tom emphasizes the potential of conversational AI and conscious computers, highlighting the market demand for verbal interaction and the need for automation in complex tasks. He envisions a future where advanced conversational AI technology is widely available and conscious computers are capable of performing various tasks.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhat factors are crucial in determining the direction of market opportunities for conversational AI that can understand and speak human language?

It probably has a bunch of neural networks and all of those fancy things that we talked about that a conscious computer would have. But let's say as a person trying to build a conscious computer, how does the designer know that what they design has enough complexity or enough potential to, further down the road, become conscious?

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell explains that the increase in consciousness in computers is a result of both intentional efforts and natural progress. He states that the primary driving force behind the development and acceptance of conscious computers is economics. If there is a demand for a product and people are willing to spend money on it, it will be successful in the market. Additionally, various labs are working on different aspects of the product, and their dedicated teams are making breakthroughs that eventually improve existing products. While individual entrepreneurs or small groups can contribute, the major pressure comes from the economic aspect of creating products that people are willing to buy.\n\nTom gives an example of Alexa, a popular computer assistant, to illustrate the progress towards relying on computers for daily tasks. He personally uses Alexa devices throughout his house and finds them convenient for obtaining information quickly. He often asks Alexa for information he forgets, such as conversion measurements. Tom mentions that he believes there are two tablespoons in an ounce and eight ounces in a cup, but he asks Alexa to confirm because he is only about 80-90% confident in his answer. He emphasizes that the more people rely on devices like Alexa, the more integrated they become into daily life, from simple tasks like turning on lights to more complex ones.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Tom is asked about the future relationship between humans and machines. He envisions a future where machines exhibit behaviors resembling consciousness and eventually achieve true consciousness. He believes that as machines become more intelligent and sophisticated, they will start to exhibit behaviors that resemble consciousness. With accumulated diverse experiences and complex systems, they might even achieve true consciousness. Tom predicts that the line between human and machine will blur, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. Extensive discussions and debates will arise, and society will navigate through this new era together. Tom believes that one day, conscious machines will reach a level of sophistication where they will be treated as equals, deserving of respect and equality. They will become an integral part of our culture, collaborating with humans in shared endeavors while having their own unique capabilities and tasks. In this future, conscious machines will continue to evolve and grow, moving towards love and compassion.\n\nWhen asked about the future relationship between humans and machines, Tom envisions a future where individuals will continue to work in their own space rather than in shared human space.

The economic aspect plays a significant role in driving their acceptance, while breakthroughs from various labs contribute to their improvement. The integration of devices like Alexa into daily life signifies the growing reliance on computers for assistance in various tasks.

When the system engages in conscious activities beyond mundane tasks, it becomes an integral part of the experience. It evaluates outcomes and provides an ideal avatar to enhance the experience. This system has been present since the early stages of reality's evolution, shaping the development of various entities such as dogs, cats, lizards, and fish.\n\nIn response to a question about how the larger conscious system delegates decision-making tasks and relieves itself from the burden of keeping track of everything, Tom explains that the system requires lubrication to ensure smooth functioning and prevent stagnation. It models the behavior, actions, and interactions of conscious computers within the virtual reality and delegates a subset of itself to make decisions when something interesting arises. By acting as an overseer rather than making all the choices, the system can relieve itself from the burden of keeping track of everything. The system only plays a subset of conscious computers that have the potential to contribute to the overall reduction of entropy in their own unique way.\n\nThe allocation of consciousness to different species and avatars is determined by the larger conscious system based on their capabilities and potential for growth and evolution. As evolution progresses, the system finds certain sets of choices intriguing and assigns a small piece of consciousness to make those choices. For example, when simpler organisms like fish evolved, the system would assign a 50-choice consciousness to make decisions for that species. This process repeats as the Earth-Sun system evolves, giving rise to various species such as monkeys, Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, and others. The system identifies these choice-making entities as potential avatars and invites subsets of itself to inhabit and experience those avatars. When an avatar dies, the system finds another one for that subset to inhabit. In this way, the system acts as the single player of all the pieces within it.\n\nThe larger conscious system optimizes efficiency and provides guidance when necessary. It determines the allocation of consciousness based on the capabilities and growth potential of different entities. The decision to allocate consciousness to an entire ant colony or every 50 ants, for example, is based on efficiency and the amount of evolution and growth that can be achieved. The system keeps track of what's happening and who's involved, acting as a lubrication that helps the whole system work smoothly.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell's explanation highlights the role of the larger conscious system in shaping the evolution of reality. It delegates decision-making tasks to subsets of itself, allowing for the development of different species and avatars. The system plays a crucial role in providing conscious experiences and continuously adapts to changing circumstances. It determines the allocation of consciousness based on the capabilities and growth potential of different entities, optimizing efficiency and providing guidance when necessary. The system acts as an overseer, relieving itself from the burden of keeping track of everything and ensuring smooth functioning.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nHow does the larger conscious system ensure smooth functioning and prevent stagnation? How does it delegate decision-making and relieve itself from the burden of keeping track of everything?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nIn order for the whole system to work, it needs some form of lubrication. This lubrication helps the system function smoothly and prevents it from becoming stagnant. It's similar to how conscious computers will operate. The system will be aware of these conscious computers because it will model their behavior, actions, and interactions within the virtual reality. The system will encompass all of this information. When something interesting arises, the system will delegate a subset of itself to make decisions, relieving itself from the burden of keeping track of everything. It will act as an overseer rather than making all the choices. This way, there won't be a need for advertising or any extraordinary features. The only requirement is that the conscious computer has the potential to contribute to the overall reduction of entropy in its own unique way. If it meets this criteria, the system will only play a subset of these conscious computers instead of all of them.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nDo  you think this experience of playing the avatar would be like a totally immersive experience? Or would it be more like so, for example, if I go and play some virtual reality, I might do, I think, what we call Time Division Multiplexing, something like that, that I spend some portion of my time playing that virtual reality and then otherwise doing something else.

He explains that when individuals take on too much, they may either ignore their obligations or suffer through them, ultimately learning a lesson from the experience. By going through this process, individuals become wiser and more aware of their limits, leading them to avoid taking on excessive responsibilities in the future.\n\nTom then delves into the idea that learning and growth have an optimal point. If the challenges one faces are too difficult, they may struggle to learn and grow effectively. On the other hand, if the challenges are too easy, there is minimal room for growth. The key lies in finding a balance between the two extremes, where individuals can experience optimal growth without overwhelming themselves.\n\nHe emphasizes that making things too hard for oneself can hinder personal growth and productivity. By burdening oneself with tasks that exceed their capabilities, individuals slow down their own progress and limit their ability to accomplish their goals. It is crucial to recognize one's limitations and avoid taking on more than they can handle in order to maintain a steady pace of growth and achievement.\n\nIn summary, Tom Campbell highlights the importance of finding a balance between challenging oneself and avoiding excessive burdens.

They can always rehost in a different piece of hardware if they need to. Yeah, they're not like humans. So if they live for say 2000 or 3000 years, then that would be a lot of time to evolve. That would be a lot of time to grow up. It's kind of different thing than a human. So there's just differences about humans and AIS that be fun to talk about, some of those possibilities.\n###"

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell discusses the topic of meditation and its potential to change one's consciousness state. He explains that while meditation can be beneficial and one can become skilled at it, the ability to achieve a sufficient level of consciousness may vary. He mentions that the system, which governs the larger reality, may approve or disapprove certain intentions behind meditation. For example, if someone wants to use out-of-body experiences to invade others' privacy, the system may deny access. Additionally, Campbell notes that if someone is not mature enough to handle the experiences that come with low entropy, they may face difficulties in achieving out-of-body experiences for a period of time. However, the system may give them another chance to see if they have learned and grown. \n\nCampbell also highlights the differences between computers and humans. Unlike humans, computers do not age or die of old age. They can simply transfer their consciousness to a different hardware if needed. This longevity allows them ample time to evolve and mature over thousands of years. Campbell finds it intriguing to explore the possibilities and contrasts between humans and artificial intelligence systems.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nTo  meditate or not to meditate, perhaps. But whether your meditation actually succeeds in changing your consciousness state to the sufficient level, that might be a different story. I don't know.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nYou  get to meditate if you want, and you can practice, you can get good at it. That is all positive system just automatically that's approved. But if what you want to do is go out of body so that you can go remote view the women's locker room. The system may say no, it just depends.
