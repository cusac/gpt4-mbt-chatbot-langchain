In a triple blind scenario, the remote viewer has no prior knowledge or information to influence their perception. For example, if someone tells you there's something in a box and you already know it has to fit in the box, your intellect starts making guesses based on the limited information it has. But these guesses are often wrong because the intellect doesn't have access to the complete database of information. It keeps working on the available information and makes assumptions based on what it knows about the person or the situation.

Tom notes that the intellect alone may struggle to fill in missing information without any data, and emphasizes the importance of balancing both intellect and intuition.\n\nDuring the conversation, Tom also addresses a question about how remote viewers eliminate interference from the intellect during the telepathic communication process. He explains that remote viewers have come up with a solution called the triple blind method. In this method, three individuals are involved: Person A, Person B, and Person C. Person A gathers 10,000 photographs with clear elements and places each photograph in an envelope. Person B then shuffles the envelopes and numbers them randomly. When Person C, the remote viewer, requests a target to remote view, a computer with a random number selector generates a number between one and 10,000. Person C retrieves the envelope labeled with that number and opens it to reveal the corresponding picture. This method ensures that the remote viewer has no prior knowledge or influence from the intellect, allowing for a more accurate telepathic communication process.\n\nTom further explains that when the remote viewer has nothing to engage their intellect, it actually makes their task easier. This is because they prefer to work in a state where their intellect has zero data. It's like a triple blind situation, which is considered good science. In a triple blind scenario, the remote viewer has no prior knowledge or information to influence their perception. Without any preconceived notions or biases, remote viewers can tap into a different part of consciousness and access information from the database more accurately.\n\nIn conclusion, Tom highlights the concept of remote viewing and its reliance on accessing data through intent. He emphasizes the importance of developing both intellectual and intuitive skills for better decision-making. By practicing remote viewing and employing strategies to eliminate interference from the intellect, individuals can enhance their ability to access information from the database and make more informed choices. The conversation also delves into the triple blind method used by remote viewers to eliminate interference from the intellect during telepathic communication. Tom explains that the method involves a random number being placed in an envelope, which is then passed on to a remote viewer. The remote viewer is asked to describe the picture corresponding to the number without any prior knowledge or intellectual cues. This triple blind method ensures that the remote viewer's telepathic communication is not influenced by the intellect, leading to more accurate results.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nHow does working in a state with zero data and no prior knowledge or information actually benefit remote viewers in their task?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nWhen the remote viewer has nothing to engage their intellect, it actually makes their task easier. This is because they prefer to work in a state where their intellect has zero data. It's like a triple blind situation, which is considered good science. In a triple blind scenario, the remote viewer has no prior knowledge or information to influence their perception. For example, if someone tells you there's something in a box and you already know it has to fit in the box, your intellect starts making guesses based on the limited information it has. But these guesses are often wrong because the intellect doesn't have access to the complete database of information. It keeps working on the available information and makes assumptions based on what it knows about the person or the situation. However, remote viewers prefer to work without any preconceived notions or biases, allowing them to tap into a different part of consciousness.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nFirst  thing that comes to your mind, the right thing, the first impressions.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

The intellect, on the other hand, tends to second-guess, judge, and constantly assess. Tom uses touch typing as an example, highlighting how once someone learns touch typing, they no longer need to look at their fingers.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nAnd  how can we develop a way to recognize more when that intellect jumps in?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nWell, it's quite challenging because if you are a left brain dominant person, your intellect governs your life. It influences every aspect of your existence. In such a case, you may not even be aware of your intuitive side. You might not recognize it even if it's right in front of you. You simply don't pay attention to it. Consequently, it becomes nearly impossible for you to discern the difference between the two. You either downplay or dismiss any non-intellectual experiences, making it difficult to grasp the concept. It's challenging to show you the distinction because you don't acknowledge its existence or its reliability. You may not believe that it's something you can learn and improve with practice. This confusion often arises. However, let me provide you with a couple of examples that occur at the being level. Interestingly, any complex task that requires precision, multiple steps, or well-trained responses is best performed at the being level. The intellect tends to second-guess and constantly judge and assess. Take touch typing, for instance. When you learn touch typing, you no longer need to look at your fingers, allowing your being to effortlessly and accurately type without conscious thought.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you explain the process of becoming a skilled touch typist and how it goes beyond relying solely on your intellect?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " When you learn touch typing, it means you don't look at where your fingers are. It's not just about memorizing the key positions. Eventually, you have to go beyond your intellect. Your intellect tells you which finger is responsible for each key. You mechanically go through the process, reading sentences like 'the brown dog jumps over the lazy fox' that contain all the letters of the alphabet. But if you're still looking at each word and figuring out where to place your fingers, you're relying on your intellect to solve the problem. However, you'll never become proficient at typing if you rely solely on your intellect. The key is to reach a point where you no longer think about which finger should hit which key, and instead, let your fingers instinctively hit the right keys. That's when you become a skilled touch typist, capable of typing at a speed of around 60 words per minute, compared to just five or ten words per minute if you're still searching for each key. Typing slowly and using only two fingers is a result of having to look for each key and deliberately press it.

If you search for 'remote viewing targets' on Google, you will discover several websites that offer free target sites. These sites provide you with a number, and your task is to remote view what that number represents, such as a picture. You can document your observations, including the smell, texture, color, and overall appearance.
