Tom suggests suppressing amusement if it may not be well-received by others, but still allowing oneself to feel and enjoy it in one's own way. He emphasizes the importance of taking a step back from work and seriousness to just be oneself, as this allows for the appreciation of the delightful things in life. Tom gives examples such as a magnificent sunset, a leisurely walk in the park, or the simple pleasure of walking barefoot in the mud, all of which can bring immense joy when one is fully present and able to appreciate these experiences.\n\nIn response to a question about embracing the joy of play during summertime, especially when it comes to engaging with children, Tom shares his perspective. He describes the pure delight he experiences when he finds himself barefoot in the mud, squishing it between his toes. He believes that having fun is important, and summertime provides the perfect opportunity for that. Tom encourages everyone to engage in games and activities, particularly with their children. He suggests becoming an active participant in their games, getting down to their level, and playing the same games they do. Tom emphasizes that life is not meant to be a spectator sport and that it's about fully embracing every moment. He encourages people to let go of taking themselves too seriously and to immerse themselves in the world of their children. Tom believes that playing with young children is not only fun but also incredibly rewarding.\n\nWhen asked how one can ensure active participation in the activities their children enjoy, regardless of their age, and why it is important to make that effort, Tom responds by acknowledging that some people may not be interested in the same things as their children. However, he personally finds it enjoyable and highly fulfilling to engage in activities with his young children or even his teenage children. He believes it is important to make an effort to participate in the things they enjoy because it strengthens the bond between parent and child. By actively participating, parents show their children that they value their interests and are willing to spend quality time with them. This not only creates lasting memories but also fosters a sense of connection and support within the family. Tom emphasizes that being present and engaged in their children's activities allows parents to better understand their children's world and perspectives, which can lead to deeper communication and a stronger relationship overall.\n\nThe conversation highlights the importance of embracing one's authentic self and finding joy in life. Tom emphasizes the need to be mindful of others' feelings and to consider their perspective when expressing amusement. He encourages individuals to take a step back from work and seriousness to appreciate the delightful things in life. Additionally, Tom shares his perspective on embracing the joy of play during summertime, particularly when engaging with children.

Finding humor in those situations can help you realize how unnecessary it was to get so worked up over something that ultimately led to a disaster.

It makes you wonder why you went through all that trouble when a different perspective could have made everything work out so much better.

By leveraging your imagination, you can immerse yourself in an imaginary space and allow it to unfold naturally, without trying to control it. This approach achieves the same outcome as meditation because it removes the intellect from the equation, allowing you to tap into intuitive space. Through this method, you can access paranormal abilities such as remote viewing, mind-to-mind communication, and extracting information from databases without the need for extensive discipline training. As you practice imagining, you will improve your ability to create and let go of imagination themes.

And then you look back and you see that those were good times, because you weren't engaging your self centeredness, because you just didn't have the time for that kind of petty stuff. You were just too busy or whatever, and they turn out to be really good times in retrospect, even if they were very busy and hectic times when you were in them. There's a lot of fun going on. We just don't see it, and we just don't let ourselves get involved in it. We stay off on the sideline and watch it or maybe imagine it. That's okay. So anyway, we've done it.
