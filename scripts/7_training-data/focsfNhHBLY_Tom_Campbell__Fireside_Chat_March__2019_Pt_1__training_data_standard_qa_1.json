It wasn't just about me; in fact, I remained mostly quiet throughout the proceedings and only spoke when spoken to, much like most individuals sitting on a witness stand, being the focus of attention. So, there was a process taking place involving multiple parties. It wasn't just me and a judge. However, the judges had a capability that judges in our culture don't possess.

Plus all the other horrors where before believing the NPC theory that's a non player character would one act now that they have a mental soother to comfort them and potentially become inactive in the name of justice and love.

He emphasizes the importance of accepting reality without necessarily approving of it and suggests focusing on the positive aspects of the world while striving to influence others in a positive way. Tom acknowledges that there are individuals who make poor choices, leading to negative occurrences like animal abuse, but suggests implementing laws and regulations to discourage such behavior. However, he cautions that penalties primarily instill fear rather than promoting personal growth. Tom advises leading by example and educating others as effective ways to make a difference, but recognizes that change ultimately lies within the individual. He believes in finding joy and not letting negativity dominate one's life. Tom concludes by emphasizing the need to protect the well-being of conscious beings suffering from horrific experiences and encourages accepting the reality of the world while influencing others through positive actions and guidance.\n\nIn response to a question about trauma, Tom explains that the system intervenes by temporarily replacing conscious beings, including humans, with NPCs to alleviate their suffering. When individuals experience overwhelming distress, it can impact their consciousness, leading to withdrawal and insecurity. The system steps in by embodying these individuals through its own consciousness, providing relief and an opportunity for healing and growth. However, Tom clarifies that the system respects free will and does not manipulate or control individuals. Its intervention is temporary and aimed at alleviating suffering.\n\nThe conversation delves into the system's approach to trauma and the prevention of long-lasting damage to consciousness. Tom explains that the system replaces conscious beings, such as children who have experienced significant trauma, with NPCs. By doing so, the system prevents prolonged pain and potential damage to the consciousness of these individuals. Tom emphasizes that this intervention is not limited to humans but extends to all conscious beings, including animals. The system aims to facilitate the growth of the entire system and avoids allowing excessive suffering that could cause irreparable harm to consciousness.\n\nTom further illustrates the system's intervention by providing an example of falling from a high building. He explains that if someone were to fall from a high building, they would lose consciousness before hitting the ground, sparing them from experiencing the excruciating pain and impact. This example highlights the system's ability to intervene and protect consciousness from extreme suffering.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Tom emphasizes the system's respect for free will and the importance of personal growth. He acknowledges that negative occurrences and harm can still happen but emphasizes that the system tends to intervene when the harm becomes excessive. Tom suggests that implementing laws and regulations can discourage harmful behavior, but he cautions against relying solely on penalties, as they primarily instill fear rather than promoting personal growth.\n\nTom advises leading by example and educating others as effective ways to make a positive difference.

        "completion": " Sure, that's fine. The moral consequences and judgment lie not in the actions themselves, but in the underlying intentions. It's not about what you do, but why you do it. If your intention is to use your abilities to help and heal people, while also taking care of your own needs like paying rent, buying gas, and eating, and you receive some payment for your services, then there is no issue with that. However, if you were to use your mind to heal people but exploit their desperation by charging exorbitant fees, targeting only wealthy individuals, that would reflect a negative attitude and greed on your part. Even worse, if you were to intentionally make people ill and then charge them money to heal them, that would be a despicable confidence game and a lower level of consciousness.

The moral consequences and judgment lie not in the actions themselves, but in the underlying intentions. It's not about what you do, but why you do it. If your intention is to use your abilities to help and heal people, while also taking care of your own needs like paying rent, buying gas, and eating, and you receive some payment for your services, then there is no issue with that. However, if you were to use your mind to heal people but exploit their desperation by charging exorbitant fees, targeting only wealthy individuals, that would reflect a negative attitude and greed on your part. Even worse, if you were to intentionally make people ill and then charge them money to heal them, that would be a despicable confidence game and a lower level of consciousness.

Wealth, he said, is not inherently evil; it is simply a circumstance that can be used to help others and be part of the solution.

I want to emphasize that the current lifespan we have is not a fundamental aspect of our existence. If we look back in history, humans used to have a life expectancy of around 35 years. Those who lived beyond that were considered exceptionally old due to the dangerous nature of life back then.

We can't keep having births nearly equal deaths, as that would lead to unsustainable population growth. The system would have to juggle many factors in order to maintain balance. However, if people are allowed to age significantly, it would depend on what we actually need. Should we terminate and start over? Is that a beneficial approach?

        "prompt": "Summary:\n\n###\nTom Campbell begins the conversation by discussing the possibility of a person receiving mathematical knowledge from a goddess. He explains that the person must have a strong background in mathematics, as only mathematicians or physicists would describe equations as \"gorgeous.\" He clarifies that when the yogi claims to receive this knowledge from a goddess, it is a metaphorical explanation of how they access and receive information. Campbell emphasizes that these metaphors should not be taken too literally, as they are unique to the individual's interpretation.\n\nCampbell presents two possible reasons for why someone may have this ability. Firstly, they may have a deep interest in mathematics and find beauty in equations. With practice and patience, they could develop the ability to receive mathematical information. They may even solve unsolved mathematical problems or proofs. The second possibility is that the larger consciousness system, mentioned earlier by Campbell, creates these unusual experiences to help others realize the possibilities beyond everyday understanding.\n\nIn response to the question about a math genius named Srinivas of Brahmajan, Campbell acknowledges that it is possible to encounter young boys with a deep understanding of complex mathematical concepts. However, he does not specifically mention Srinivas or provide an opinion on him.\n\nThe conversation then delves into examples of extraordinary occurrences that challenge our understanding of reality and serve as reminders that our perception of the world is limited. Campbell explains that even young boys, as young as eight years old, can vividly recount their past lives as World War I pilots. They can recall intricate details such as the pilot's name, the aircraft they flew, and even the location where they were shot down. These occurrences are not limited to past-life memories alone. Instances of twins being born with psychic abilities and various other unexplainable phenomena are also encountered. These occurrences are scattered across different cultures and serve as wake-up calls for us to recognize the existence of the inexplicable.\n\nCampbell suggests that these extraordinary experiences may be orchestrated by the larger consciousness system to prompt individuals who perceive equations as beautiful and awe-inspiring to ponder how they achieve such brilliance.

However, that's perfectly fine. The most important thing you need in this situation is courage. So, when you find yourself in a situation where fear makes you recoil, prevents you from reaching out, makes you hide, keeps you quiet, or even makes you angry, it's crucial to acknowledge that fear. You're already aware that you have fear, which is a great starting point. Now, you must gather the courage to tell yourself that you won't let fear control you. It's not about simply acting differently, but about fundamentally changing your mindset. Let's say you're afraid to trust others or meet new people. When you come across an opportunity to get closer to someone, but it requires trust, and you feel the urge to withdraw, that's when you need to catch yourself and say, 'No, I won't be that way. I will trust.' Instead of retreating, you must move forward and embrace that relationship or connection. Over time, you'll notice that the fear starts to fade away as trust grows. It takes courage to resist reacting to fear and to let it go. By letting go of fear, I mean that when fear arises and tells you to run away, to avoid danger, and to not get involved, you choose to get involved anyway.

However, he clarifies that it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a physical entity in this reality causing it. The same goes for dark energy, which is the additional energy that drives the expansion of the universe. The expansion is actually accelerating, and there isn't a clear explanation for it yet. Tom sees it as just another aspect of the rule set.\n\nTom further explains that expanding space is easy to simulate mathematically. He gives an example of writing an equation for a sphere and using a do loop in a small laptop computer to continuously increase the values of X, Y, and Z, making the space expand. In less than a minute, he can have a simulated universe in the computer that is larger than our entire physical universe.\n\nIn the realm of computer simulations, Tom can create a universe that is much larger than our physical universe by using simple equations and increasing the exponent until the computer can no longer handle it. He can even make it expand with acceleration. It doesn't require any physical substance that we can't perceive or measure. Instead, we can attribute the expansion to an unknown force that causes it and holds galaxies together. We don't have to invent a new type of matter like dark matter to explain it. We just need to acknowledge the existence of this force and the presence of an invisible energy that drives the acceleration.\n\nOverall, Tom's perspective on dark matter and dark energy aligns with the understanding that there is an unknown force at play, similar to magic, that explains the phenomena observed in the universe. He emphasizes that while these concepts are necessary for simulations and understanding the rule set, they don't necessarily imply the existence of physical entities causing them. The complexity of the real world cannot be accurately modeled by continuous functions alone. Tom believes that these attributes are simply part of the rule set governing our universe and do not have a physical existence. He suggests acknowledging their existence and remaining open to further understanding in the future, while also considering the possibility that they may never be fully comprehended.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nCan you provide your perspective on the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Are they simply attributes of the rule set governing our universe, or do you believe they have a physical existence?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nI completely agree with the person who wrote this question. These attributes are simply part of the rule set, nothing more. As of now, it would be an overstatement to claim that they are physical. Let's acknowledge their existence and perhaps we will gain further understanding in the future. Alternatively, we may never fully comprehend them. It is possible that these attributes are just minor adjustments the system had to incorporate into the rule set to ensure its functionality.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nAll  right, thank you. One last question from our leftover questions. This one is from Claudio. And Claudio says the sun broadcasts information in all directions em radiations, including. Photons. Our dreams are more efficient virtual realities. We can just think of the sun, and it appears it starts from the observer asking a question in PMR. Starts from the object observed sending information out that can sometimes reach an observer. Have you seen more efficient virtual realities using this concept? Information starting from the observer? Do you agree that this way is more efficient than PMR? And do you know why PMR wasn't done starting from observers instead of from virtual objects sending information out?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
        "completion": " Alright, let me clarify things, Claudio. In this virtual reality, the sun is not a real sun, but rather a virtual representation. According to the rule set of this virtual world, the sun emits energy in the form of particles like photons and protons, which is referred to as the solar wind. It's interesting to note that in this virtual reality, one could construct a large sailing ship in space that reflects this solar wind, allowing it to propel through space, similar to how physical wind propels ships on water. However, it's important to understand that these particles are also virtual, just like the entire reality itself. The sun and the particles don't exist in a physical sense; they are merely data produced by the rule set and transmitted to the players. This tight rule set governs all energy interactions within this reality, including cellular metabolism and other energetic processes. As a result, this virtual reality is highly interactive. Our actions have consequences, and we are influenced by the actions of others. Even the sun, despite its massive size compared to anything else in this virtual world, can be influenced to some extent. For example, if we were able to redirect a massive asteroid towards the sun, it might cause a slight disturbance in its motion. However, due to the sun's immense mass, the effect would be minimal and temporary. Nevertheless, the possibility of such interactions between different elements within this virtual reality is intriguing, as it highlights the interconnectedness and potential for dynamic changes within the system.\n###"
