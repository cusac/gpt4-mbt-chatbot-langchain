Tom is one of my favorite guests, host, co hosts, because we get to talk about a lot of his theories and bring them into the you know, Tom has so much information out there and it attracts so many different types of people. A lot of my work know for those people that know, want to dig deep, and a lot of times that's just the women.

Resistance occurs when we set intentions and get clear on what we want, but end up focusing on all the things we don't want. This becomes problematic because we tend to look at the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause or fear. For example, when it comes to our health, instead of identifying the deeper fear or subconscious fear, we focus on the symptoms. The same goes for weight and abundance. We say we want to lose weight or have abundance, but then we fixate on the factors causing the problem or the bills that need to be paid. These hidden fears distract us from addressing the root issues. Additionally, we need to explore the process of letting go and releasing the intensity of our emotions. Often, when we feel uncomfortable, we seek distractions and fall into addictive behaviors that are rooted in our fears and choices. By tying all these aspects together, we can gain a better understanding of how to move forward.\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

We focus on the doing, but the real issue lies elsewhere. It's not that we fail to do what's healthy or beneficial for us; it's that there's a deeper reason why we don't take those actions. You see, the problem lies in our being, not in our doing. We engage in behaviors that aren't good for us, like neglecting exercise or indulging in snacks and desserts, despite knowing we shouldn't. It's not solely because our actions are incorrect; they are merely the final link in a chain of events. The root of the problem lies in our being.

        "completion": " I believe that personal change is not a permanent state. It may seem like you can alter things for a short period of time, maybe a month or even six months, but eventually, everything reverts back to its original state. This is simply the way things are. It's the way you are. It's your narrative. To truly make a lasting change, you must start from the core and work your way up. You can't begin at the surface level, where you're merely trying to fix the story you believe in, because that story isn't real. And what's real will always bring you back to that same old story you're trying to escape from. You see, that's the real you. So, you need to dig deep and uncover the true essence of who you are. Everything else is just a way for you to cope with the fear that lies beneath. Fear is at the very root of it all. You fear that you're not a good person, that you're not likable, that you're not enough. These fears reside within you, and you don't want to confront them, do you? That's the fundamental issue. You need to acknowledge and accept who you truly are. Once you have a clear understanding of your true self, then you have the power to make changes. But until you reach that level of self-awareness, it's incredibly challenging to alter anything because you're stuck in that state. It's like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic - all the effort you put into it doesn't really matter in the end because it's all just part of the story. It's all just a game you're playing, and it doesn't provide a long-lasting solution. It's all temporary, and true change can only come from a deeper understanding and transformation of oneself.\n###"

It may seem like you can alter things for a short period of time, maybe a month or even six months, but eventually, everything reverts back to its original state. This is simply the way things are. It's the way you are. It's your narrative. To truly make a lasting change, you must start from the core and work your way up. You can't begin at the surface level, where you're merely trying to fix the story you believe in, because that story isn't real. And what's real will always bring you back to that same old story you're trying to escape from. You see, that's the real you. So, you need to dig deep and uncover the true essence of who you are. Everything else is just a way for you to cope with the fear that lies beneath. Fear is at the very root of it all. You fear that you're not a good person, that you're not likable, that you're not enough. These fears reside within you, and you don't want to confront them, do you? That's the fundamental issue. You need to acknowledge and accept who you truly are. Once you have a clear understanding of your true self, then you have the power to make changes. But until you reach that level of self-awareness, it's incredibly challenging to alter anything because you're stuck in that state. It's like rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic - all the effort you put into it doesn't really matter in the end because it's all just part of the story. It's all just a game you're playing, and it doesn't provide a long-lasting solution. It's all temporary, and true change can only come from a deeper understanding and transformation of oneself.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhat is the key to achieving lasting personal change and how can one align their actions with their true desires to make changes that feel authentic and effortless?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",

He believes that these narratives are tied to our fears and hinder our progress in truly understanding ourselves.\n\nTom describes how individuals cling to these narratives, refusing to confront life head-on and instead seeking control and safety in familiar patterns. He provides an example of a young woman who drops out of a high-stress game due to the fear of inadequacy, temporarily alleviating her anxiety. He also mentions how career choices can be influenced by underlying fears, such as settling for being a nurse instead of pursuing a dream of becoming a doctor out of fear of not getting into medical school.\n\nAccording to Tom, these decisions rooted in fear become the stories we tell ourselves, justifications for the strategies we adopt to cope with our fears. However, he emphasizes that these stories are not absolute truths but rather beliefs and excuses for the paths we have taken. Tom suggests that embracing authenticity and confronting our fears head-on is essential for personal growth and overcoming the weight gain associated with fear.\n\nIn response to a question about the underlying issue that causes us to justify our actions and behaviors, and how exploring our subconscious motivations can help us understand why we engage in certain behaviors, Tom explains that the real problem lies in our fears. He believes that overeating is merely a symptom of a deeper issue. To truly understand why we engage in certain behaviors, we need to explore our subconscious motivations. Tom suggests that the desire to be thin may come from our rational mind, but to uncover the true reasons behind our actions, we must delve into our subconscious.\n\nOverall, Tom's perspective on weight gain and its connection to fear goes beyond genetics. He believes that addressing and accepting fears, as well as taking responsibility for our choices, are crucial steps towards losing weight and achieving personal growth. By recognizing the narratives we create for ourselves and understanding their connection to fear, individuals can break free from the patterns that hold them back and embrace a healthier and more fulfilling life. Exploring our subconscious motivations can help us uncover the underlying issues that cause us to justify our actions and behaviors, leading to a deeper understanding of ourselves and our behaviors.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nWhat is the underlying issue that causes us to justify our actions and behaviors, and how can exploring our subconscious motivations help us understand why we engage in certain behaviors?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\nI believe that things happen the way they do because it allows us to justify our actions and behaviors. It's possible that I may be confusing some people with my explanation, but the underlying issue is that you are correct. The problem we think we have is not the actual problem. We often believe that overeating is the problem, but it is merely a symptom of a deeper issue. The real problem lies in our fears. Why do we feel the need to be overweight? That is the question we should be asking ourselves. You might argue that you don't want to be heavy, that you want to be thin. However, that desire is coming from your rational mind. To truly understand why you engage in certain behaviors, you need to explore your subconscious motivations.\n###\n\nQuestioner:\n\n###\nIt,  because you're always getting something out of all of our stories, right?\n###\n\nAgent:\n\n###\n",
