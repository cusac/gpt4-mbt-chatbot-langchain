SPEAKER_A

Okay,  this now is going to be just Q and A. We're just going to talk I've talked enough a little bit about the Q and A is there are are no inappropriate questions. As long as the questions are honest questions, then they're good questions. And don't worry about if it's elementary or if it's not a good question or whatever. Just don't worry about that. Ask the question if you have it. Also, don't worry about if you think it's a hard question or an impolite question or even a rude question. All questions are welcome as long as they're just honest questions. You're not trying to make a speech or make a point. You just want to know. So as long as it's an honest question, then there are no bad questions and there are nothing that's out of bounds. And we're not limiting the questions to just what we talked about today and yesterday. It's just questions. This is just open to whatever it is you'd like to know about that you think I might be able to help you with. That takes nothing off the table. And the reason I say that is I don't want people to be shy about asking what they think are hard questions like, how do you know all this stuff anyway? Things like that.

SPEAKER_B

I  have an announcement. Before we do the questions, please do not ask your question if you don't have the microphone in your hand, because the people on YouTube want to hear your questions. And if you guys have used YouTube, you know that. So otherwise, it's very difficult because Justin will be trying to hear what you said and type it in. But that's very difficult. So please just wait a second until you get the microphone. We have two. And just raise your hands. And there's plenty of time. I think everybody will get their questions answered. And Dagda wants to go first, and then you raised your hand here. You can be second. Okay. This is a question about dealing with narcissists.

SPEAKER_A

Dealing  with what?

SPEAKER_B

Narcissists.

SPEAKER_A

Narcissists?

SPEAKER_B

Narcissism  in your life. If you have narcissists in your life and relating that to MBT theory and talking about how that relates to high entropy.

SPEAKER_A

Well,  narcissism, I guess, in short, it's called just self love. You're in love with yourself. Everything is about you. You're at the center of the universe. In your own mind, that's narcissism. Most people have some degree of that going on, right? That's your ego. It's about you. So it's a matter of degree you can have ego and not be a narcissist. The narcissism is the extreme end of that. When you go all the way out about as far as that can possibly go, that's generally what we call narcissism. I suspect then, if we're talking about being self centered, which is an ego reaction, and the ego is derived from fear, we would say that narcissism, of course, is very fear based. The reason you're like that is because you're so insecure and you're covering that insecurity that fear up with control. It's all about you. That's how you deal with that fear. So it puts you on the far end of the fear. Love dichotomy you're on the far end, over with the fear. I would suspect that narcissists are very fearful  and if you have a narcissist in your life and you've looked and you've seen all the stuff online and you've gone there, what's a good way to start dealing with that? What do you. Well  there's a couple of choices there. If this is somebody that lives next door, stay home. If this is somebody that lives in your house, then that's a different thing. In other words, that sort of thing you avoid when you can because there's very little you can do to help somebody who's that far into the fear and into themselves. It's very difficult. You're certainly not going to give them a lecture and have them agree to it. You're certainly not going to point out that they're narcissist and have them say, oh thank you for giving me that information. None of that's going to work. You could just be kind to them, give them a hug, but not hang around long enough to get the story to listen to them very long. But when you do see them, you pass them. You could just make them feel loved and cared for because the reason they're like that is because they don't feel any of that loved or cared for. And the reason they don't is because they build all this wall around themselves because they've shut everything else out. They're the only one that exists inside their wall and it's all about them and they don't think that loved and being cared for is possible. So they get bitter inside their little wall, inside their little castle. And when they get bitter they aren't very nice. So it's because they don't feel any of that love or any of that care for that really that they're in there. And then they played this I can't lose if I don't play. That's when they built the wall. Well they're not going to play, they're going to build a wall and now they think they can't lose. Of course building a wall around yourself ensures that you will lose. It's a very common strategy. So you can, when you're around them if it's not for very long because being around such a person for a long time can be taxing, can be draining. But a couple of things to keep in mind if it's a short time, give them a hug, tell them they're a nice person, kiss them when a cheek, tell them you got to run now, got something you have to do. Just that will take them by such a surprise because nobody's ever said that to them before. They will be so shocked that they'll think, I wonder what she wants. Wonder what she's after. But if it turns out you're not after anything, you just tell her that on random occasions or him, whatever, whomever, that'll start to soften them, you'll see? A little chink may start in the wall or maybe not. Depends on how entrenched they are, you see? But that's about as much as you can do for a person like that. Now, the really important thing is that you don't get attached in any way to their narcissism if it makes you angry or upsets you. Now you're attached. That's a connection. And then you'll get upset. You won't like being around them because they upset you, and you always feel bad afterwards and so on. If they say rude things to you and that upsets you, that's a connection to them. You're attached. So you got to let that go. You got to let your own fear and ego go. So if they're rude and if they're whatever, then that's okay. It's just them. It's the way they are. It's no reason for you to get upset about it the way they are, you see? So if you can do that, then a little bit of time around them isn't quite so painful anymore, because they just are who they are. And you accept that, and you realize that you can't talk them out of it. All you can do is give them a couple of positive things whenever you get a chance and see if maybe that'll eventually soak in and make a little crack in that wall. It might, it might not, but it certainly will confuse them and make them wonder what you're up to. Right? So that's the way I'd say the big thing, is make sure you're not attached to any of it. It doesn't upset you. It's their thing to deal with. You're not there to heal them. You're not there to change their mind. You're not there to tell them how wrong they are. You're just there. If they live in your house or somebody that in your family or somebody you need to deal with from time to time, then you deal with them and remain detached from that dysfunction. So it just never touches you. Oh, it touches you because I say something rude to you or do something or whatever, but it just slides right off. It's like you're Teflon coated. You don't accept any of it. You're not connected to any of it. None of it gets under your skin. None of it annoys you. You don't say, oh, how awful. Oh, look at that. She's trying to manipulate me. And you don't get in any of that. It's just you let it be. And when you do that, it'll probably change that person. That person will start to act differently around you. Part of the reason they act like that is because of the reaction they get back when you act and get a reaction, at least that lets you know that you're alive. And you're being noticed. And sometimes that's all you've got is that you're alive and that you're being noticed. Why do some children do bad things for attention? It's the same thing. It means they're alive, they have impact on the world and they get attention. They have power. Power is to do something out in the world that changes something. Well, if they get you upset, well, they have power, they have influence, they can make you upset. All they have to do is call you names or say rude things and you go up in a dizzy and hoot and holler. And that means they not only are alive, they have power, you see? So when you take all that away, then that tactic is no longer working. They may look for another way of relating that's more functional. And if you give them those little hugs and hand squeezes every once in a while, those things together might actually help. So that's how I'd say to deal with it very important. Don't get attached to it. Don't let it touch you. If it doesn't touch you, it can't bother you, it can't upset you, it can't annoy you. And if it does annoy you, it's not their problem, it's your problem. You choose to let it annoy you, and that's something you need to get over. So I think that's about as much as I could say about that. Does that help any?

SPEAKER_B

Thank  you so much. Tom, my question is going to be about meditation and point of consciousness and going out of body. In your book, you wrote that before you met Bob Monroe, you had some meditation experience, you fell over a chair, and I'm hoping you can expand and maybe offer some advice on other people when they do that. Meditation is something I do a lot, but don't always get to point consciousness. And from point consciousness inconsistent and difficult to then go out of body and explore the logic conscious system. So I'm hoping you can offer some technique tips. I don't know if you can, but along those lines, thank you.

SPEAKER_A

A lot of people have a similar question and they have trouble with the end game, the idea of meditation. They start that and it works pretty well. They get to where it's pretty successful most of the time, but it kind of gets stuck there. They have a hard time getting beyond that level and it just seems to be stuck. They meditate, but it isn't really leading them to bigger and better places. The thing that is most likely the problem is that you're not just being in the process and open in the process. You have some expectation, some idea of where it is you want to go, what it is you want it to feel like, oh, I want to go out of body. I want to get into the larger conscious system and fly around and see what my friends are doing back in China. I want to do this, I want to do that. I want this expansiveness. I want to be in that point consciousness and find nirvana, that sort of thing. If you get some sort of expectation, some sort of goal of where you're going, that will get in the way. That will get in the way more than anything. If you have an expectation and a goal, whatever happens to you, if it doesn't meet that expectation, you discard it. I'm sitting here and no, that's not it. I haven't done it yet. I haven't done it yet. Well, that interferes with your process of doing it because the process will probably not be like what you expect. You have to get rid of those expectations. You have to just meditate and let it be whatever it is, with no expectation, no goal. It's not that I want to go out of body and I want to do this. I want to get in that point consciousness and do these things. All those goals will get in the way. Just experience it, be it, enjoy it with nothing attached to it, no strings attached. It is whatever it is. I'll learn from it what I can and do that. Now, you have to, at the same time, be open to things happening. You have to be very open to whatever it is that does happen to you. And it would be helpful if you would express what it is you're trying to accomplish. Not where it is you want to go, but what it is you're trying to accomplish. I would like to better understand the larger reality because I think that would help me grow. Or I think this is why I want to do that, or I think it'll make me a better person. Something that has to do with your growing up. The system. If you're serious about that, the system will try to help you. If you've got some ideas, and if you don't not really sure that your ideas are good ones, you can say, I need to grow up. I want to do that, but I really don't know how. Help me pick a path. Help me take the next step. What do I need to do? You can have those ideas in your mind. And if you do, that enough. You'll start to be getting intuition. You'll start to be getting things that are going to tell you signs, whatever that is. But you'll get things that will help you make that decision in which way you want to go. And then when things do happen, when you do see something, hear something, don't try to judge it or second guess it. Whatever it is, no matter how ridiculous it seems. Engage it, go with it, become a part of it, enter into it. The second thing that makes it difficult for people is because of their expectation. When they see something that they don't understand or doesn't seem to be important, they discard it immediately. Well, how do they know what's important? Well, because of their expectations and where they think they're going and whatever. How can you judge what's important? You see, you don't know what's important. So you're there in your meditation, and what you see is a rain cloud. Go away, rain cloud. That's just my imagination. What you see is a pink rabbit standing by a big flower. Nonsense. Must have seen that in a child's book someday or something like that, and you pass out. That's not what I want. I want and you're not sure what you want, but you know it's not a rabbit and a flower. You know it's not a rain cloud. So you discard all those things instead of discarding them, go into them, whatever it is. That's there is probably a doorway, and it's probably waiting until you let go of that intellect enough that you can engage that doorway. You let go of the control enough to engage that doorway. So when you see that pink rabbit standing next to the six foot tall Daisy, very improbable, right? It's a cartoon experience, but go to it, explore it, say hello to the rabbit and become with it. Go into it, treat it like a portal, and then see what happens. Well, it may be like Alice in Wonderland. The rabbit may run someplace and go down a hole if they do follow it, you see? And that's how things get started. So the biggest problem is your own expectations and your own throwing away meaningless stuff, because you're sure that must have just come out of your imagination. But see, that's a judgment. Oh, that just must have come out of my imagination. Well, you're judging the value of what you have when you have no understanding to judge that value. That's the problem. So don't judge anything. Just deal with everything. That means that sometimes things won't go anywhere. All right? You go into the rain cloud and nothing happens. That's okay. Don't go into that rain cloud thinking, Ah, I'm going to do that, and something will happen. Tom told me it'll happen if I go chase that bunny down a hole. Because now you're doing the same thing again. You're building up expectations of something happening. You see, you need to let it happen. Engage, but don't try to lead the process. Just experience the process at your being level. Don't judge it. Don't try to ask, is this me making it up or not? Don't say any of that stuff. Just engage with whatever happens and leave that intent out there all the time. That I'd really like some help here. I'd like to grow. I'd like to understand things better. Can you help me with this? Things will start to happen for you if you can do that. But you have to be careful because people who live out of their heads have a hard time letting that go. They have a hard time when something happens, not instantly judging it, judging its value. Where did this come from? Why is it there? Is this important? Nah, throw it away. Yes. If it is, then you expect something. What do I expect to happen with this? Well, maybe it's this, this or the other. And you go and it's not that. And it's like, Nah, you throw that away. So it's your own stuff now. That's what I'm saying. Mostly gets in the way of people. That's why they have problems. You just have to say, no expectations, no goals. I'm just going to experience this. I'm just going to be and shut out all my sense data, detach from it, and just exist that way, just be that way. And that will get you to point consciousness with that kind of an attitude. If it's, I'm going to go to point consciousness and I got to get there, it's going to be like this. It's like floating in a point of consciousness in the void, because I've heard people say that, and I want to float like a point of conscious in the void. And you got that picture and that idea that'll get in the way. That's your intellect trying to lead you someplace, that's you trying to control the situation, to be the way you want it. Let go of that control. And just in your mind intent, you can say, it'd be nice if I could go to point consciousness or see that'd be okay. I'd like that. But then when you actually meditate, you might have that intention, but you don't have that need. You're not looking for it. You're just going to experience, and you'll accept whatever happens. But my intention is I want to learn and grow and experience these things. So maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't. Whichever way, it's okay. I'm not goal oriented. I'm being level. I'm experience oriented. I'm going to have this experience. And maybe the experience is that you just sit there very quietly for half an hour, and that's your experience. Well, be happy with that. Half an hour quiet is really valuable these days. Don't write that off as something, oh, didn't work. It should be impossible to say it didn't work unless you actually get pain during it. It worked. So that's just a different attitude, a different perspective, I think will fix that. But that's a very common problem, and it's mostly with people who live out of their heads. Judge everything instantly, because that's the way it works in this world. In this world, you get information, and immediately you want to vet it. Where does information come from? Is this from an expert? Or is this just some crank? Should I take this seriously or should I not? Is it valuable or not valuable? Because there's so much information, we have to do that. Otherwise we're overwhelmed. If we looked at everything like it was important, a lot of things aren't. So it's just a natural kind of instinct reaction to act that way as things happen. We analyze them, we judge them, and then we either throw them away or do more with them. And that works fine here. It doesn't work in your meditation, doesn't work in the outer body. It's counterproductive. There very productive. Here it doesn't work out at all there. There you just have to be and be happy with whatever happens. And if that's nothing, you have to be happy with that and not push on it. Okay, here we have somebody with the mic.

SPEAKER_B

I  have so many questions, but I'll pick one as you're talking. They're all kind of swimming around in my head.

SPEAKER_A

Yes,  that's pretty typical by now. There's lots and lots of questions.

SPEAKER_B

One  of the things I'm trying to figure out is the hierarchy. I hate to use the word hierarchy, but it's the only way I can figure it out. So in the virtual world, you've got consciousness that has created a virtual world. And so when I go out of body as this consciousness, I'm going to my where am I going when I'm out of body?

SPEAKER_A

When  you're out of body, you are in a virtual reality. Leave this virtual reality, and you're in a different virtual reality, different rule set, different function. It's still a virtual reality. Consciousness itself is the only thing that's fundamental. Everything else is a product of consciousness. It's virtual. It's computed. So when you die here, you'll wake up in another virtual reality. When you go out of body, you're in a virtual reality. When you dream, you're in a virtual reality. Different virtual realities with different rule sets and different properties. And there are all places where you can learn, and there are all places where you can make choices. If you were in a reality where you couldn't make free will choices, it would be a useless reality. We wouldn't exist. There's no point for a reality where you can't make free will choices. There's no reason for it to exist. So all of your experiences are going to be in virtual realities. And the point of those virtual realities is for you to make choices, and by those choices help you evolve or deevolve. That's what we're doing in our dream. So that's where you go. When you go out of body, you're in some other virtual reality. And you're in a virtual reality that has a rule set that your intent tends to manifest its intention very quickly. There. Here your intent can manifest in reality if you work on it for a long time and if you have a lot of strength to do it and if you didn't have to move the probability too much to begin with. But there your intent can manifest reality very quickly and very precisely. And what you find there often has to do with what you bring to it. It's not a place. It's not like visiting Chicago, and you're going to find a museum here, and you're going to find an aquarium there and all those other things. It's not like visiting Chicago. It's different. What you find there, for the most part, will be a reflection of what you bring there. Now, there are things there. It's not just what you bring. It's not the only thing that's there. It's not just a mind trip inside your head there. You are going to another virtual reality. There are other entities that are in that virtual reality. So there's things outside of you, but how you interact and what happens to a large extent has to do with what you bring to it. That's why everybody has a different experience when they go in these realities, because it's personal. Going to Chicago is not personal. Chicago is just the same for everybody. This isn't like that.

SPEAKER_B

Are  those other entities part of the same?

SPEAKER_A

Yes.  Everything's part of the same conscious. So is your know and your cat and your dog and the horses and the bumblebees and everything that can make a free will. Choice is all part of the same conscious system. And they're all basically doing the same thing we are. Even the bumblebee. They're all making choices and evolving or devolving according to the choice. They're just doing it on a smaller level. They have a little tiny decision space. We happen to have a very broad, very big decision space. And it really doesn't have to do with intelligence so much as it has to do with the size of the decision space. The reason we figure so highly, I guess, in the evolution of this planet is that we have the capacity to do so much damage and so much good. We can interact with things. There's lots of choices we have. We have lots and lots of choices. We may find that a porpoise or a whale may have a much bigger brain than we have. And who knows, maybe they're even more intelligent than we are, but they don't have the array of choices that we have because their environment doesn't give them that many choices. All you have to do is look at the variation on our planet and see all the different choices that different people have made. We create choices. You build a machine, it creates choices. So that's kind of the difference. But everything is evolving for the same reasons in the same way. We get at least two of them. Okay, there'll be time for more. That's not your last shot. We can just keep asking. Thanks. You see a little green light on it? I do. If you don't see a little green light on your mic, push the button once and the orange light will go out and the green light will come on and then you're live. So the question I have this particular reality or PMR existence? From a biological and reproductive advantage perspective, it seems like a certain amount of fear is actually beneficial to that game. Even some social fear might be beneficial to reproductive success. Why would we be exposed to that if we're trying to get rid of fear? It's not that the system exposes us to things like that. We create that. There is a lot of fear, but I would argue that any of it is beneficial. Now, it may appear to be beneficial in the short term. Right. A lot of things can be beneficial in the short term. I need cash. I can rob a bank. I get cash. In the short term, seems like a good idea, but in the long term, it's really a bad idea. Say it's a really bad choice, even though it looks like it was a good choice in the short term. That's the way these fear choices are. They may look like, okay, fear gets you ahead sometimes, but it really doesn't in the long term. Fear always gets you behind, not ahead. Now, because we make choices that are fearful, then they create things that other people have to deal with and that we have to deal with. So part of what we have to deal with is because of other people's fear. Well, that's just more challenges for us to deal with it. So for that reason, it can be part of our growth, because we need to deal now with a narcissist, and that's challenging. Narcissists can really get on your nerves quickly. So it's challenging to sit down with somebody that's all about them and that everybody else is awful and everybody else is the problem, and they're the only thing in the whole world that is worth anything. And you sit with somebody like that, and that can be very tiring, but it also can be very educational. You can learn a lot. You can learn compassion. You can learn to let go of your own fear. Wonderful. So just to take this more basic, if you're being careful, like you're not going to walk where the lion goes hunting or walk through poison ivy, is that a different classification than fear? Yeah. Yes. That's not fear at all. Okay. That's not at all fear. And people make that confusion a lot. Being fearless is very different than being stupid. The reason you don't go in the woods at night when the bears are in their territorial phase is because you're not stupid. Well, you're fearless. Why don't you jump off this cliff? No, I'm fearless, but I'm not stupid. You see, now we will talk about that with fear. If you run into that bear and you're fearless, you will be able to think of the most rational thing to do. And if you're prepared, you'll know, do you stare at the bear and back away slowly, or do you look away and back away slowly? Do you get out your air horn and blow it? Or would that just make you mad? You see, you've maybe studied. You have some. Information. But you know that the worst thing you could do is scream and run because any predator chases anything that runs, even if they're not hungry. It's just an instinct. You run, it chases and you don't want to know what it's going to do if it catches you and it will catch you. So running, which is what the person who's fearful is most likely to do, you see that fear isn't helpful if you're in any situation you're in, you can do better with a clear mind that can think rationally, that's not balled up by fear than you can with a fearful mind. And for not getting yourself into a bad situation in the first place, don't depend on fear for that, depend on not being stupid. Depend on doing things with some thought ahead of it. So there is no a lot of people will say, well, it doesn't staying out of the woods at night, isn't that a good fear? No, you stay out of the woods at night because you know better. It's not a smart thing to do. But if you have to be in those woods at night because you have no choice your car broke down there or you have to go to grandma's house and I'll see you on the side of the woods and you have to go now and it's dark. But you can't help that this is important, then the fear isn't going to do you any good. You see, if you have to be in a situation, the fear will just make you more vulnerable. So there isn't the good fear. Oh, we have these fears that protect us. We ought to be protected by our good sense. The fear will just make us act stupidly. Somebody has a mic, so remember, there's two mics. So when one person gets done, there's another one being delivered, right? So when the one ends, if you want to get a mic, put your hands up then and you can get the second mic. Okay? My question is about dreams. And do you think that some dreams are not virtual realities with entities that you encounter but are merely hallucinations? Some dreams? Yeah, dreams can be all sorts of things. Most of a person's dreams are interactions in a dream, virtual reality. And often the way they go is that you just find yourself in a situation and you have to make choices. Well, that's like taking a test at school, right? You find yourself in a situation and here's a question you have to answer it. Well, they tend to be like that. You find yourself in a burning building, you find yourself in some situation where somebody's threatening you, you find yourself where only you can save the world or something. And now what are you going to do about it? Well, these are just things set up to give you choices to make. And in dreams you always make the choices from the being level so that's the typical dream. But then there's other dreams. What did Justin say? Justin is the guy that keeps all this technically equipment running there with the headphone on. So we really need to appreciate Justin some. You have these other dreams and Justin said last night all I was doing was pulling cords and trying them and they didn't work because we spent like 2 hours trying to find a cord that would work. So I can remember times when I had a mailing out like Christmas cards or something and I just licked 200 envelopes. Lick them and you're doing you lick them and you do them and he's about 3 hours of licking envelopes, that kind of thing. Well, I go to bed that night and what am I doing? Licking envelopes all night long? Well, you've not gone to another reality where they have envelopes for you to lick. That's not it, that's just you. What would we say? Obsessed. You've kind of gotten obsessed or in that rut, a mental rut. You've done it so much that you're having trouble breaking out of it. So like you say, that's not really a dream. So dreams can be any number of things. Dreams can be daydreams too. You don't have to be asleep. A lot of people are good at daydreaming and they're not a whole lot different than night dreaming. They're pretty much the same thing. It's just that it's not dark outside and you're not unconscious when you're doing it. And in the daydreams you tend to have more of your intellect engaged. And it's not just being level, but all of that is action in a mental space. So yeah, dreams can be other things. They can just be kind of hallucinations like licking envelopes or something like that. That don't mean anything, just kind of meaningless trivia. Because that's what your current obsession is. That's what you've been doing and doing and doing and it's on your mind or that's a problem you've been having. So you have that problem, you've been fighting with your boss. So when you dream that there is your boss and you're carrying that same fight you just had today in the office and that kind of thing is a little different. Interesting thing that you bring up is that we get data in our data stream, but we don't get anything that tells us where the data came from. We don't get anything that tells us why the data is in that data stream. We only get the data we never get to see behind the data or who sent the data or why they sent it. That's up for us to decide and to act with, with our free will. So you're never sure where the data comes from when you're trying to meditate or contact a nonphysical entity or something like that. You never know where that data is coming from. Could be you because you make up data. We can create data we're consciousness, and we can take data and feed it to ourselves, and we can't tell the difference between what we feed to ourselves and what comes from outside of us immediately. There's no tags on them that lets you know that. So in a dream, it's the same way you're getting data, and the source is always unknown. That's why you always have to be skeptical and not get too wrapped up and too serious about the information you get. You never know why you got it or not. With experience, you get better at knowing, but even then, you have to always stay skeptical. Did I get it? Okay, who's got the mic?

SPEAKER_B

Hi,  Tom.

SPEAKER_A

Hello.

SPEAKER_B

Could  you please speak to the subject of incarnation with regard to the point of incarnating? Would that be, in your experience, at the point of conception, possibly in gestation? Could it be after the baby's born? And maybe in that case, would a soul or a consciousness be hovering over a baby, deciding whether or not to occupy it? And are there times where it decides not to? And maybe is there another consciousness possibly waiting to step in?

SPEAKER_A

All  of the six or seven things that you mentioned are all possible. It's not that it only can happen one way. They're all possible. Most of them are kind of in the margins, the way it typically works. We go through a cycle of death and birth and how consciousness connects. The individuated unit of consciousness is kind of the collector of all of the experiences that it has. It sums them all up and learns from the whole of all of them. That's what we're calling the individuated unit of consciousness. Now, that individuated unit of consciousness, we'll start, I guess, here, go through the cycle because we always get back to the same point that individual unit of consciousness decides on having another incarnation, another lifetime, another set of experience. It picks what it thinks it most needs to help round out its collection and the things it has to learn and so on. So when it does that, it takes a piece of itself. And that piece of itself contains none of the intellectual part, but all of the quality part, all the being level. So that's the data. So it takes a piece of itself, takes away the intellect. You're left with everything that describes the quality of that individuated unit of consciousness. That's what they are at the core, not what they think about, just what they are. You take that. We call that a free will awareness unit. Sounds very techy, doesn't a free will awareness unit. Anyway, that's what happens when a physicist writes a book. You end up with a free will awareness unit. And this free will awareness unit then logs onto the game, if you will, and that becomes the consciousness for an avatar. That becomes the player of an avatar. All right. Now, exactly when does that happen? It could happen. All of the things that you said, okay, that Free Will Awareness Unit could be just waiting for the right opportunity to get in that spot. So it may be waiting to get into that spot in this virtual reality until from before the pregnancy even occurs. It might be, as you say, hovering about. It's not really hovering. It's in a different reality frame. It's just existing. But it may have to wait for the opportunity. And when the opportunity comes, it will basically log on, if you will, and when it does, it's totally immersed when it logs into that character. See, when we're playing World of Warcraft, anytime, we can put it on pause and go up and make a sandwich, right, and come back. Well, that's because we're aware in this reality and we're aware of our Elf in that reality. Well, when this Free Will Awareness Unit logs on and connects, that's it. It's not aware of anything else. All information comes from the computer for a data stream describing what that avatar is doing, that's it. So when that avatar gets to the point that there's something interesting there to experience, that's when the player would want to connect with it. And if the player is actually already connected, if you will, with, say, the mother or the father or the parent or the situation, they may want to connect almost immediately, because now they're there. They're part of fetus, but their only intake, the only input or the input that they're getting in their data stream is what a fetus experiences. Well, in the first couple of weeks, that's nothing. No brains developed yet, no body's developed yet. Nothing's developed. It's just a little wad of cells doesn't have an experience. So if it were to inhabit it, then it just would exist in the void. There would be no experience coming in. There's nothing in its data, no sensory capability. The rule set says no data input at that point. Eventually there'll be data input. So as soon as that fetus is able to feel, hear, whatever, then that entity, that player, would feel and hear those things. So now, if you're a player, when would you get into the game? Would you get in earlier or a little later or whatever? Well, those infants, before they're born have a pretty interesting life toward at least the last half of it. They do somersaults. They kick, they stretch, make a few punches. They have all kinds of things they do. They see they can see light. It's not perfectly black, and there's enough light that gets through that. They can see shades of light. They can hear sounds. They can hear Mom's voice, dad's voice. They can hear the TV, the dog bark. They can get a fair amount of sensory data at that point. And then, of course, at birth, then the sensory data just blossoms. Free Will Awareness Unit can tap into any of that at any time. They want to. Typically, I would think they would come in just after the data input became interesting, which would be probably early somewhere, maybe in the fourth, 5th, 6th month gestation. Because then there's light, there's sound. Organs have developed then, and there's things that they because they have to get used to that. That's all they have to deal with, that's their whole world is whatever. That data they get from those sites, those sounds, those pushes. And they're going to have to learn how to interpret the data stream according to their experience. That's how we learn how to interpret. We get this data, and we interpret as this reality. Well, how did we learn how to do that? We learned how to do that when we started with that infant. Well, that's light. Okay, I see this stuff going by well, that's interesting. What is it? Well, eventually it becomes light after you get born. What's that? Oh, that's my hand. Is that attached to me? Well, doesn't seem to be. It just moves all by itself. And a little later they find out, yeah, it is attached to me. I can control it. So they have to learn everything about reality, everything about how the world works, and then language, everything about what things are called. All of that has to be learned. They're getting the data stream. They have to learn how to interpret it, and they learn from scratch how to interpret it so that when they get older, they get data. They know exactly what that data means. Now, it's also possible for an entity to come in and be part of a fetus be born. And I've known this to happen several times. It turns out that there's, say, a serious birth defect, a problem of some sort, and the entity that's there, of course, that just happens. There's a lot of randomness in how all those chromosomes and genes all happen to end up together. And sometimes it isn't good. Sometimes they don't draw a good draw from that probability distribution of all the possibilities. And we may have a serious birth defect. Well, the entity that's already picked that may say, whoa, that wasn't on my list of things to do. I'm not ready for that. I'm not sure I can handle that and deal with it well. So I thought this would be an appropriate situation for me to learn in. But that's not really too appropriate. Somebody with a little more quality needs to do that because they could get value out of that handicap. They could learn from being in that handicap position. So at that point, you may find a switch where one said, no, I don't want to be here, and another one said, Well, I'll take that. That would be a good learning experience. And you might get a switch then. So 1 may be, hey, the other way there. It's not that hard. You log on, you log off. It's not that hard. We're just talking about routing data streams to the right recipient. It's not really a big deal. Remember, it's just a virtual reality. So that does happen in that situation. Now, I don't know that it happens in other situations because there's not some really major reason then that's not going to happen. So it's in the margins. It's only occasionally that you get those kinds of switches going on. Now, even further out on those margins, sometimes those switches even occur in adults. Sometimes you get an adult that just wants out, not doing well, not focused well, and you may have another entity who is in a hurry and want to skips all that upfront process and who wants in. Yeah, walk in and they can make a switch there. But now we're way out in the margins. Doesn't happen very often, but it can happen. So in a digital, virtual reality, anything can happen, but not everything is likely, you see. So there's lots of things that happen that are very unlikely and happen only in the 100% to 1% kind of thing. So lots of weird things can go on in this reality. Now let's take the cycle on around. So then that infant grows up and it's consciousness, it's free will awareness, it learns how to interpret the data and it goes on. It makes choices, it gets old and it drops dead. And when it drops dead, suddenly its awareness that was only tuned to the data coming to it, it finds itself awake somewhere else in another reality, sort of like a dream, but different. And the reality that it just lived begins to fade like a dream. So it's a whole lot like a dream. You see, it's kind of a similar thing. It fades and it gets this idea about, well, what's next? Oh, it sees the light over there, you see. Now it doesn't know how to move because it's no longer like the legs and the rest of it. So it needs to go to the light. And one of the ways that it can have a sense of motion is by creating a background that it moves relative to. That's why people go through tunnels, because if they don't have a sense of motion, then they're not moving. So you need a tunnel, because here's the tunnel and here's you. And you're moving through the tunnel. So you've got a background against which you can move. Otherwise you can't move. You're stuck because you've got these habits of thinking about the way the world has to be. So the motion makes you more comfortable because now you feel like you're in a place and you move wherever you get greeted. You get made to relax, to let go. Everything's fine depending on how much handholding you need. Depends on whether what you see and what you get. Those who need little handholding matriculate through very quickly. Those who need a lot of handholding, maybe they see relatives other people to try to relax them and tell them that it's all fine. All right, so then what happens that during that time from when you die, you start reintegrating with your individual ed unit of consciousness. You, the free will Awareness unit, are now reintegrating with you, the individuated unit of consciousness so that Free will Awareness unit is done. We can delete that. It's done. It goes away. It's no longer functional. It's only functional as a player for that avatar. That was its job. When that's done, it's done. Now you reintegrate back into remember, it was just a piece of that individual unit of consciousness to start with. Now it integrates back into the individual unit of consciousness. The individuated unit of consciousness says, collects all that data, assesses it with all the other data, and said, wow, you really did well. Great. Now we need to do some more of this, or let's do that again, because that was productive. You could learn a little more in that way. And it does whatever it does. It agrees to take a particular thing. It takes a portion of itself. Being level only makes a free will awareness unit out of it, goes back, logs in again, and does it again. So that's kind of the way the process works. Some people get real wrapped up around that because they want their free will awareness unit, which is their own physical, their own avatar identity here, to go on and on and on. It doesn't you do go on and on and on as consciousness because you take that experience packet, bring it back to the whole, the whole integrates it and learns from it. They're actually integrating and learning from it the whole time you're experiencing it. It's not like, I have to wait. But you become back, and the part of the whole looks at it, realizes what the whole needs, that's you an individual unit of consciousness. You're a piece of that, and then it gets back in the game again. Okay? So that's kind of the way it normally works now. It's different for different sorts of people. If you're very new to this, if you're a consciousness that hasn't had a lot of experience, then there isn't a lot of planning. You just jump back in. Any avatar will do any situation. Doesn't matter. All you need is experience. You don't have things to work on because you don't have enough experience to have things to work on. So at that case, it's in and out, jump in, jump out, back in. No planning, not a lot of thought to it. Wherever. As you get more experience, you realize, this part of me is pretty grown, but this part not so much. Let's focus on that part this time. And then you try to pick a situation that'll help you do that. So as you then go around a few more times, you get to a point where you're not so much focused on your own growth. You're focused on how can you help, how can you be of service? So it changes over time, is what you're doing. But what I gave you the first time was just kind of the typical way that it goes around. Some people get bothered by the fact that that avatar personality is no more. But remember that avatar personality is now an integrated part of something bigger. It's a collection of things. It never goes away as far as not like it just disappears. It just gets included in a bigger picture. It's another lifetime of a bigger picture. And that whole has all that memory, if you will, of all the things each individual entity did. So in that sense, it still lives on, right? But it's not an individuated. It's not a free will awareness unit out making choices. It's part of this history. So it's not any longer out making choices, but it's part of the history. It's part of the whole. And what it brought to the whole is unique and stays there forever. So that character lives on in that sense, but it doesn't live on in the sense that it's still making free will choices and whatever. That's going to be a different character. This next free will awareness unit is a different avatar. You see different character, and then that one will get added to the whole and that's the process. So those individuals become data in a library, if you will. It's a history. But now this library is really a very amazing library because it not only saves the facts, we go to a library and we read a book. We can find out about what Coronado did when he came to Central America or something. We can read all the facts, places he went, and kind of stuff he had with him and all of that. But what we don't know is what he felt, what he thought. We don't know when he sneezed, we don't know how happy or unhappy he was. We don't know his ambitions, his fears. We don't know any of that. Well, all of that gets in that database. So this database, when I say it's history, it's not this flat history that you're thinking of as history. It's everything that was that person. Everything they thought, everything they felt, everything they experienced, whether they ever expressed it or not, is not the point. See, all of that stuff that was significant to them is all part of that, all part of that history. So that's all there. So now you're thinking, well, maybe they do still exist because that's all there. Well, they exist completely, except they don't have free will anymore. They're not making choices. Other than that, the whole thing is there with all its history, but they're no longer making free will choices. The free will choices are happening by the players who are playing avatars in the virtual reality. That's how that cycle of reincarnation works. Other people are disappointed by the fact that when they get there if they need some handholding and Uncle Fred and Aunt Mary show up to greet them and so on that it's unlikely that's really Aunt Mary and Uncle Fred that's the larger conscious system doing a really good impersonation of Uncle Fred and Aunt Mary. And how can it do such a good impersonation? It's got all the data, every feeling, every thought, every opinion. It's all the clothes they wore. It's all there. So it's a really good impersonation. Why? Because Uncle Fred and Aunt Mary are now part of this larger free will awareness unit that's got other avatars, other places, you see. But that impersonation is perfect. I mean, right down to every nuance. And what's better about it is that it's also probabilistic. So if you want to, you can use your intent and instead of getting what Uncle Fred would be most likely to say if you asked him a particular question and he'll have all of Uncle Fred's memories. So if you Uncle Fred where'd you hide the treasure? He could tell you oh, it's under the left right corner of the bedroom under the floor. You'd have that information because that's what's in the database. But you could say, Uncle Fred. Or you could, in your mind, say, I only want to hear the third most likely thing that Uncle Fred would say to me or the 10th most likely thing that Uncle Fred would say to me and it'll go into the probability and it'll pull out something. That's the 10th most likely thing that Uncle Fred would tell you. And in that case he may not tell you about that treasure under the floor. He may not. So when you're dealing in these databases your intent has to be very specific about what you want the question you're asking and the database you're looking for. It's like any other database. If you just ask and you're not specific you just get junk back. It's like going into Google and putting in love. Well, you'll get 70 million replies back half of which you really don't want to see. So that's the way it is. If you just say well, Uncle Fred, what about this? Well, is that the 10th most or is that the most probable or what? You see there's different answers. Now the default is the most probable answer. That's kind of the default because all the probabilities are in there that describe Uncle Fred. So when I say it's an impersonation it's an exact personation except it's not doing free will choices and it's the larger consciousness system that is acting in its place is making the choices. Like if you ask a question then it has the choice how to answer that question. That's the larger conscious system because the system is going to give you answers that calm you down and make you feel welcome and safe. That's the whole point. You need to let go. Let go of the trauma, let go of the anxiety, let go of the oh my God, I'm dead. I left six children and a widow and I didn't have any insurance. Now what's going to happen? You got to let go of all of that stuff and that's why they are there to help you. Let go feel it's. Okay? That's the point of it. Okay, I probably over answered that question, but I know it's an issue that a lot of people have. So I went a little further on it. Tom, who has the mic?

SPEAKER_B

Interesting  answer. I have a lot of questions but I'm trying to pick maybe I want to pick where we left off because I think some people want to maybe know. But I'm looking at it this way. So it seems we are in a matrix or computer. We are all pixel and characters in this game and there are other games out there and there are other games that are run by the same programmer and we all have different realities and we all can go from one dimension to different and do other kind of games if we want to. Or maybe the level are different and all is to expand the consciousness which is the source. I know you said don't ask a lot of questions sometimes because then it becomes your analytical part. But then you were the one who did search yourself and you've tried to find answers. So looking at it that way, I don't want to accept it per se because that's what the religion used to say, accept it for what it is. So why the source needs this games to expand? What is source? I know it's energy. What I'm saying is beyond that why there is a need for these games and it's not a free will per se because me knowing now I'm in game, I feel trapped in the game and I'm thinking I don't want to be trapped, I'm a free will. And then I'm thinking whether there is a non physical out there. Can I pick and be that nonphysical? Okay, I'll assist. But you don't have even that choice to get there per se. Maybe there is a way, but I think even the picking seems to be hierarchical in a way that you pick this person to be there or you pick that person to be the guide. What's the purpose?

SPEAKER_A

The  purpose is that the larger consciousness system found that it had to evolve by decreasing its entropy. Because it's an information system. And information systems, that's how they stay alive. An information system has information which requires the bits to be in some sort of order that makes sense, that creates information. If all the bits are random, that's high entropy and there's no information. So it's this information system. It wants more pattern, more structure. And if the structure has meaning and content that makes sense, then that's more. Information. So that's what it does. Now, then it got to the point that, all right, it had kind of run about as far as it could get with that as just one thing. But it found out that it could create novelty, could create more possibilities if it broke into pieces and let these pieces interact with each other with free will. So now you have pieces interacting with each other with free will, and you can't tell what they're going to do. It's free will. So now suddenly there's lots and lots of more possibilities that could happen than just one entity trying to just do what it can think of. So we have all these interactions going on and we have a lot of that. So now there's lots and lots of these individuated units of consciousness all interacting with each other and with the larger consciousness system, trying to evolve the quality of their consciousness. Well, what are these chunks of consciousness? Well, they're just information. They're little chunks of information. They have memory, right? They have analysis ability, all the things that you think of. They're little chips off the old block of the larger consciousness system. They need to evolve. What you've got is something I would describe as like a chat room. You've got this chat room with a million chatters in it, and they're all chatting away, and they're supposed to grow up from that and learn how to build structure and meaning and content. That's a hard thing to do when you're in a chat room. You have no idea that the information you get has anything in it other than somebody has made it up just for fun. You don't know. There's no traction. You have very little accountability. You have no accountability, actually. There's very few consequences. You can say anything, oh, I'm an 800 pound gorilla and I live on the dark side of the moon. And that goes out in the chat room. So there's no traction there. There's no feedback that you can count on. It's very hard to learn anything. So that's what you had with all of these individual unit of consciousness, and all they are is information traders. I mean, that's what an information system does. It trades information. It's a big chat room. Learning was slow. They weren't decreasing their entropy very much. It wasn't working very well. So the system said, we need a reality frame, a virtual reality with a tighter rule set where there are consequences, where when you do something, you get the consequences of that. It makes a difference in what you do next. So that's why that needed a virtual reality. So then it goes and says, well, let's develop a virtual reality. Let's try this and see if this works. Didn't work. Keeps trying, keep trying, keep trying. Eventually it gets a virtual reality that's stable enough to evolve critters that have interesting choices. And as it does initially, the consciousness system is playing all the parts. This is the virtual reality. So it's playing all the parts itself. But once those critters evolve to the point that are interesting, then other units of consciousness say well, I want to play, I want to play. And they go in and they become now the consciousness, the free will awareness unit for various avatars. And eventually the whole system is populated by free will awareness units playing avatars. And there are very few players that are played by the computer, very few of those NPCs. But now they have a real tight rule set that connects everything. Anything I do affects other people and what they do affects me. My intent changes future probability. I'm in a classroom that's got feedback about how I'm doing, whether I'm doing really well or not. I can learn now much, much faster. So that's why we need the virtual realities. It was there to serve as a generator of useful experience. Useful, I mean, in the sense that you can grow up with it because you get feedback. So that's why we needed the virtual reality. And yes, there are more virtual realities than just this one. There are others and they're all populated doing similar things in as far as they're trying to grow up. But you don't put all your eggs in one basket. This may not be the optimal way to have a virtual reality for consciousness to evolve in. So hey, let's have a whole bunch of them. Different formats, different kinds of things, different limitations, different rule sets. And see if some of them aren't a lot more efficient than others. Because the ones that are more efficient, well, we'll make those bigger and better and most. Of the entities will go over there and the ones that aren't, we'll close those down. We'll take those entities and let them join the one that's more efficient and so on. So there's lots of virtual realities for different reasons, for different kinds of entities. We get a lot of different kinds of entities here from the bumblebees to the dolphins to the people. And that's why it's here and that's why we're in this game and we are just who we are. So we were kind of loose individual units of conscious playing in a big chat game. We found a faster path for evolving. That was the virtual reality we get here and oh no, we got a lot of fear. It's a scary place in these virtual realities because you do have consequences. Well, I've never had consequences before. You do have responsibilities. Well, never had really responsibilities before. You get all this feedback and when you get this feedback it gets pretty scary. Now life isn't as trivial as it was before. You're just chatting. It didn't matter what you said. You got stuff back and yeah, nothing really mattered too much. It wasn't all that serious. Now it seems to be serious. You're as avatar and you don't do the right thing. You get eaten by a tiger, something happens, get smacked. So you have to start paying attention. And fear is part of the process of growing up. So it's a scary place, and you have to deal with that fear. And it's not like that created fear in you. It's just that you weren't very grown up, so the fear was a natural part of you. It's just now giving you a place to express it and get rid of it. Whereas before you had that same level of quality, but you had no way, really to express it and outgrow it. That's what the virtual reality is for. So we get here, and initially, it was kind of a tough trip to make. And the entities that did it found out that it was a lot tougher than they had thought. It's a hard game to play, and it evolved the way it evolved. So the way it is now, you see this virtual reality and you say, well, it seems to be a mean, unpleasant place. A lot of people are in pain and not having a good time. Well, if you go back two or 300 years, it was a lot worse. And you go back two or three more hundred years before that, it was a lot worse. And you can keep going back and you can find that we have been progressing over time. But this thing about growing up and changing yourself at the being level is a hard thing to do. But that's why we're here. That's why you need the virtual reality, and that's why there's so much pain in it, is because we're not very grown yet. But the only way to get there is to go through this process. There's no way to grow up other than making choices, seeing the results, and changing yourself to do better. That's the only way you can grow up. Nobody can come magically and grow you up. So we started wherever it is, we started from out of the chat game into the virtual reality, and we've been working at it ever since. And slowly the whole thing is getting better. But it's a slow process. It's hard to do. So that's kind of why it's there and the purpose of it. And it is slow, but it does work. And no, there is really no end to it. And the reason there's no end to it is that there is no point to where you are done. The whole thing about entropy is that if you don't work on it, it starts to become higher entropy. That's just the way it is. Second law of thermodynamics. You're stuck with that. If you don't put any energy in it, then it tends to dissolve all on its own. So you have to keep working to keep your energy, entropy low. You have to constantly be concerned about other. You can't say, okay, I'm perfect now. I really don't give a damn about you people anymore because I made it. See? Well, that's not being too perfect. You've already taken your first step backwards. So you're always concerned with those people. And because you're always concerned, you're always engaged, you're always trying to help. There's always somebody to help because there's new consciousness coming in at the bottom as needed of the system, coming out of the chat room, if you will, into the system. You're only here because you volunteered to be here because you want to be here. Because this is the fast track for growing up. And I've been around to dozens of these other reality frames, probably, I don't know, dozen and a half, two dozen frames that are realities like this with a tight enough rule set to be called physical. Your dream reality is not a very tight rule set. You do all kinds of things there. This is a tight rule set. And there aren't any of them that are any more productive or any better to be in than this one. And a lot of them are not a whole lot worse than this one either. Some of them are. Some of them are horrendously awful. Some of them got into a cycle where they deevolved and that dee evolution grew to the point that it got bigger and bigger, sort of like a whirlwind, and it kind of sucked everything down to the bottom. And those are really horrific places. So this is a good place. This is not the hard one at the bottom of the pile. That sucks. This is a good one. This is a really good virtual reality to be in. Yes, growing up is difficult, but they don't get a whole lot better than this. And we do just have to keep working at it. There's always somebody to help. You never get to the point that you just quit. Why would you want to quit? What would you do after you quit? Play a harp on a cloud. Right? That's the traditional thing you do after you quit. Well, that's not very interesting for very long. So you always are going to be engaged because you are consciousness. You interact, you have relationship, you connect with people. That's what you do. Why would you can't really do anything else. That's what we do. We connect, have relationships, make choices. And to not do that would be to dissipate. So we do it. But we do it to get more and more helpful, more and more caring, and we grow ourselves up. So it just goes on and on and on. And as we keep our entropy low, the whole system's entropy is low because our entropy is a part of its entropy, because we're a part of it. So we grow up, it grows up, and we keep going. And one day this planet will be inhabited by a lot of happy, caring, cooperative people. We'll get there one day, but we have to pay the dues to get there, which means we have to change ourselves. So it's not so much that this reality is really tough, that it sucks, that it's kind of a punishment place, that this dark, dense matter here, that's kind of the butt end of where consciousness goes. We're all the people that failed every place else, right? We're in jail down here. It's not like that. This is the fast track, believe it or not. This is the fast track to love. This is the fast track to positive evolution. You won't get a faster track than this. And as realities go, this is about as kind and sweet as it gets. We did not deevolve into a law to jungle. We have evolved up past that, and we keep getting further and further away from that. So it is a good place. Yes, there's a lot of individual pain here. But remember, this is just your life is a chapter in a very long book. Your individuated unit of consciousness may have 10,000 lives experiences. It's done, and you're one of them. And when this one goes, there'll be another one and another one, and they tend to be serially like that. Because learning is cumulative. You don't learn in parallel. You have to learn the first grade material before you can get the second grade material and so on. It's a cumulative thing. So you do it serially rather than in parallel. This is a good place to be. As hard as it might seem for us, the opportunity is here. All we have to do is get rid of that fear and bingo, everything gets good. But that's our job. That's why we're here. We're individuated units of consciousness. We're supposed to grow. It our job. And we can actually do a better job of it if we're aware of what our job is. So I hope I answered a bunch of your questions with that. Yeah.
