SPEAKER_B

And  good afternoon. This is news for the heart. It is the last Tuesday of the month. May holy man. It's like it keeps going faster and faster. We are going to take a break, so we won't be back until the fall. So I thought we'd end this season, I guess, with discussing, I don't know, some fun things to do, fun things to do over the summer, fun things to do for ourselves to play and to still be conscious of our consciousness, to grow and evolve and still enjoy life. I know some of it can come from Tom's Park, which is an excellent little book that helps us book audio ebook helps us look at ways for us to use our imagination. Also, we can join in with other people. So there are ways that that can be a lot of fun and maybe we'll start with there, but just have fun. What can we do to play, evolve and have fun while we're still doing the work to grow up? Over to you, Tony.

SPEAKER_C

Well,  that's a good thing to talk about because people, if you've ever been around someone who has a very high quality of consciousness, someone who is very spiritual person, you will find that that person does not take themselves very seriously. That that person seems to, quote, act like a child sometimes. And that's because those two go together. When you get that fear is what makes us so serious. It's that fear that not only are we very serious when we're upset or angry, that's a very serious thing, but we just take life very seriously. Every little detail is terribly important to us when we're dealing with our life. And if those details don't work out right, then we get upset. And all of that has to come from fear. So when you can lower your fear, you tend to take life with a big smile. You tend to things happen and that's the way they happen. And if it turns out it's kind of a tough thing that happens or it's a terrible thing that happens, well, that's what happens. You don't get really upset about it because being upset is not part of anybody's solution. It doesn't help anything get better. It just adds to the negativity that's already there. So yes, growing up not only is going to improve your relationships and make you a happier person, but it's going to put fun and even a little childishness back in your life. And by childishness it's something we call childishness, but it's not so much childish as it is just human. And children aren't so worried about what people think about how they're acting. They just act because it's just the way they feel. And that's a good thing. We call that childish, that our intellect isn't always kind of the censor. Well, you should be like this, and you should always be like that and stay serious and act like you're in charge or act like you're smart or act like this and that. But if you're just giggling because something's funny, well, you see, that's okay, too. If you're grown up and don't have fear, then you don't really worry at all about what other people think of you and your behavior. You're not trying to impress anyone. And when you're not trying to impress anyone, well, if something catches your fancy and it makes you giggle, then you giggle. You laugh, you have fun, you make wisecracks. And the gurus, who really are very spiritual, you'll see, they play jokes and have fun and laugh and generally have a very good time. And people say, yeah, they're so advanced, they start acting like children. Well, no, they're acting like adults that don't have fear, is what they're acting like. Children really don't have a lot of those fears either until we give them to them later on in life. So you just act natural. So fun is an important part of life. Humor is an important part of life. And we need to see humor in a lot of things. A lot of things that we see sadness in. We need to turn that around and see humor in it.

SPEAKER_B

Right.

SPEAKER_C

That  happens naturally as you get rid of your fear. So fun is good? Fun is fun. Yes. I think it's a big mistake to, one, take yourself very seriously, too seriously, and two, to really care much what other people think of how you're behaving and how you are. That's not you should be honest. You should be the way you really are. You should be what's the word? Authentic.

SPEAKER_B

Yes.

SPEAKER_C

You  should be authentic. And then you should just try that out on people. And if you being authentic causes a lot of trouble and unhappiness, well, then maybe you need to change the authentic you to something else.

SPEAKER_B

Yes.

SPEAKER_C

So  that would be a good sign that your authentic you needs some work. On the other hand, if your authentic you plays just fine, then play it. Let it be. And if other people find that, oh, I don't know, think that you're being silly, well, that's okay. That's their issue, right? That's their problem. That's not your problem. We tend to put people who are on a spiritual path and have some success on that path. We kind of put them up on a pedestal. We expect them to be serious and profound all the time. But life is not like that. Life is often amusing. People are often amusing. Now, you still have to be aware of other people's feelings, because sometimes if you find something that somebody said or did amusing, maybe they won't find you're finding it amusing. They may be insulted by your mirth. So you have to pay attention to that sometimes. Maybe you have to suppress some of that fun because you think it wouldn't play well with other people, but it doesn't mean you can't feel it and enjoy it just the same. So, yes, if your life is always focused and work work and everything is serious and constantly measuring your progress toward the goal and so on, then you need to unwind and relax and let go and just be who you are. And then there's so many things that are just delightful. I mean, when you're just being who you are. A sunset can be magnificent. Walk in the park, just walking around barefoot in the mud, it can be just really nice because you can enjoy it. Just a sensation of that mud squishing up between your toes is fun, so you ought to be able to have fun. And summertime is a good time for fun because you get outdoors. Summers are a lot more outdoorsy than the winters are for the most part. So outdoors is a good place to have fun. So play games, get involved. Play with your children. If your children are five or six or ten or 15 or whatever, they're involved in things, they play games. Instead of always sitting on the sideline watching the kids play, get out and play with them. Become part of their game. If they're only five or six years old, we'll get right down on their level and play the kind of games that they play. You and the teddy bear and your toddler can all three play hide and seek. So have fun, enjoy your children. Don't be afraid to have fun at their level, not just your level. Don't just sit by and be a spectator. Life is not a spectator, a spectator sport. It's not what it's about. It's a get involved and embrace it kind of a thing. So, yes, I think a lot of times we tend to sit by and just let life go by because we're too serious, we're too important. And if we get down and crawl around on the floor in our hands and knees while bumping a two year old with our head and making them giggle, that somehow that's unfitting for an adult to do that kind of stuff. But it's fun and very rewarding to play with your young children or even your teenage children. Do some of the things that they like to do.

SPEAKER_B

Or  your grandkids.

SPEAKER_C

Or  your grandkids.

SPEAKER_B

Yeah,  puppies, all of that.

SPEAKER_C

Yeah,  my granddaughter is really into her grandpa because she comes over, she claims, me and I'm hers, and everybody else needs to go do something else. And we spend a lot of time together, and she giggles through most of it. So it's fun for both of us to do that. I get a lot of pleasure out of her giggles and see if I can continue to be creative hour after hour, enough to keep her giggling. The challenge. But it's fun. It's just a lot of fun. And I think the point is that you should have fun in life. And if you're not having fun in life, then you're taking yourself too seriously. You need to lighten up, relax and get connected with people instead of always sitting on the sidelines. Well, I'm not very good at that, so I'll just sit and watch. You don't have to be good at it, just go get involved in it. Matter of fact, if you're terrible at it, that'll even be more fun for everybody. Everybody will laugh and you get hit right between the eyes with the tennis ball or something because you're not very good at it. And it'll still be fun and everybody will have a good time and you'll have a good time. So just engage in fun and frivolous activity just to celebrate the fact that you're alive and that the sun's shining and you're outside breathing fresh air. Just that itself can be fun. Just walking outside early in the morning when everything smells so fresh because there hasn't been any traffic for ten or 12 hours. And just take a deep breath and appreciate the stillness and that can just be fun and enjoy that. There's just thousands of little moments and opportunities every day for you to just look at the world and place you live and appreciate it and have some fun with it. Enjoy it. Things that upset you now, if you just change your perspective, they won't upset you anymore. You just have to stop needing them to be some way other than the way they are, and you just have to stop taking yourself so seriously. And when the little things don't work out well, a laugh is usually better than a cry. You see the humor in it. See the fact that you were so wadded up over getting something the way you wanted that it all crashed in the end. And instead of going and getting mad and hollering, look at it and say, that really is pretty funny. Why did I go to all that trouble to create a disaster when I could have just looked at it from another perspective and everything would have worked out so much better? And then laugh at yourself for getting all wadded up with your ego. That's an attitude that everyone should have. Having fun, feeling gratitude I think we talked about gratitude one time. Feeling gratitude for all sorts of things is often the first step toward that fun. If you have gratitude that you have healthy grandchildren, well, just don't watch them and say, well, that's nice, nice, grandkids. Get down on your knees and play with them. Do the things they do. Get down and play with your doggies or your cat. Get involved, connect with things, be a part of life. And life is not like a TV program and you're sitting in your couch watching it go by. You really need to plug in and embrace things and know things don't have to be perfect for you to embrace them. Just appreciate the parts that are good, ignore the parts that aren't, and try to pass out as many compliments as you can in a day. That would be a fun thing to do. Just watch people's faces when they get a random act of kindness comes their way. Just little things that you can do for people and don't cost a whole lot for you to do that. Most of the cost is just you paying attention, right, and wanting to make the connection. That's the key. Everything else works pretty much by itself. And besides that, fun is contagious. If you're around a lot of people who are all having fun, you will tend to have more fun too. When we were just in England a couple of months ago. One of the things the group did was in the evenings, after all the activity was over they went into one of these large rooms, got somebody's cell phone and plugged it up to the sound system that was in the room and started playing music. And people were so Pamela and I showed up one evening and everybody's dancing and having a good time. And I think a lot of people were really surprised when we got up and started dancing. Dancing is fun. It's just motion. I mean, that's a fun thing you can do just even by yourself. You don't even need a partner. All you need is a source of music and just move to the music and that's fun. And you don't worry about what other people think. Do it in your own room if you're worried about what people think. But in general, people see you having a good time will make them smile. And even if they decide to kid you a little bit, that's okay, that's fun too, because now you can have some fun looking at them, wishing that they could have fun, but they're too uptight to have fun and then you can make a little laugh at that. There they are, stuck being serious adults. So enjoy life and summer is a good time to start, but it's something you can do all year round. So yes, fun is important. Well, you walk and your walking has turned into be fun, has it not? I mean, it wasn't when you started, it was hard, it was tough and it was something you had to focus on and concentrate on and you had to push yourself a little bit each day and no, it was that sort of thing. But even though it was hard, it was still fun. It's fun when you take two minutes off that time on your walk and you feel good about that. You're getting better. Your muscles are developing a little bit. Your balance is getting better. Your walk is smoother and more efficient. And all those things are just fun things to see happening, but then just the sights you see. Okay, you walk the same thing every time. And a lot of the sites are similar, but they're still just fun. The dogs, the cats, the ducks, whatever it is that's around the other people, they can be fun, too. So it's not that you have to decide to go someplace and play. It's just play through your life. Let your life be kind of a stream of play. You play at life. That would be a good attitude. Rather than force your way, grind your teeth and get through there. Put down your head and charge. Instead of that kind of attitude, like it's a battle. Just play with it. Have fun with it. And if it pushes you, well, then stand aside, step out of the way. Let it go by. It's just an attitudinal change. So fun is part of growing up. It's part of childhood. Then we start taking ourselves more and more seriously. Then they teach us. We go to school where they teach us how to have performance anxiety. Those are the kind of first lessons we get right in kindergarten and first grade. Susie, stand up and spell the so we all have all this performance anxiety, and if you make a mistake, everybody laughs at you, and so on. So we start very early, learning to incorporate performance anxiety into our life, and then we come up with strategies. Well, the best way to not get laughed at is to just don't say anything. Never volunteer, never say anything. Just stay quiet and stay in the background. And that's a strategy for getting through life. But if you have that strategy, you're going to miss an awful lot of life. You need to step out and grasp it, engage it. That's how you deal with life. Not by standing on the side, watching it go, by, hoping nobody calls on you and asks you to do something you don't want to do or you don't know how to do or something you'll get wrong. All that's performance and not feeling good enough. Insecurities.

SPEAKER_B

Right?  I guess that's where all the public speaking fears come from, isn't it? I mean, I never even thought about it, but that's exactly what it is.

SPEAKER_C

Sure.

SPEAKER_B

Wow.

SPEAKER_C

That's  what people are afraid of. Yeah, they're afraid that all those people out there will find them wanting. Find them not good enough. Find that they didn't do a very good job, that they messed up, that they said the wrong word or pronounced something wrong or forgot their lines or whatever it is. That's just performance anxiety. A fear of being inadequate and not doing it well.

SPEAKER_B

And  because you were at some point in your life, humiliated from speaking, oh, sure. Right.

SPEAKER_C

That's  the very first lesson you learn in school. And that lesson just keeps being drummed into you and drummed into you all the way through your education. You have to perform and the performance is important that you get it right in the right way with the right form and that sort of thing. And if you get it wrong then you're the butt of the joke, right? And that's a serious problem. Well where that stems from is that if you want to manipulate people you manipulate them with fear. And if you know their fears then you can manipulate them. So teachers want their students to try harder. They want their students to go do their homework at night. They want their students to read the book and study the lesson. And if you want to motivate those students then you sit them up into situations that frighten them. All right? They're going to do their homework because otherwise when everybody gets called on in class they'll look stupid and everybody will laugh at them. So the teachers use fear as the way to manipulate children? Yeah, we call it motivate. Right? Well we're just trying to motivate them. Well true, you're trying to motivate them but what you're doing is called manipulation. You're trying to manipulate them to do things that you want them to do. Things you know, that are good for them. You see we justify it but we manipulate them all the time. Parents are always manipulating their children to do things. And with little children manipulation you have to do that some when your child starts to holler because his teddy bear's eyeball just fell out, well you need to distract him. You need to hold him, pat him on the back and then hold up a little trinket or toy and shake it in front of him. And now oh look at that. He's distracted. He forgets about the problem. So that's manipulation too. But that's okay because they're very young and that's not the same as frightening. See that's not using fear to manipulate. That's just a distraction and it's a positive distraction. Get their mind off of something that's upsetting them and onto something that's not that's more fun. So that's not a bad thing. But when you use fear to manipulate people I think that's always a bad thing. No matter how good your intentions are for trying to make somebody do something better, it's just not a good way to manipulate. And we do that all through. The boss calls everybody in and gives a little talk about how the money is getting low and two or three of you are going to have to be laid off if we don't get production up. People just use fear all the time. Coaches use fear. That's the tool. Politicians use fear. Preachers use fear. The police and the legal system use fear. That's almost the only handle that we use because it's the most effective one that allows us to manipulate people. Well, why are most people afraid of getting up and talking in front of an audience? We know they're right up here with fear and performance anxiety and getting it wrong and being humiliated. The opposite of that or the antidote for it is confidence. Once you have confidence, then that confidence doesn't come from knowing you are perfect. That confidence comes from knowing that you'll do the best you can. And if you make a mistake, that's all right. It's not a big deal. So you don't mind making the mistake. And with confidence, you can get up and give that talk. And if you mess up or forget a word or something, well, make a little joke of it and go on. And you don't feel like you want to hide when that happens. Instead, it's just part of life, you see? So confidence is developed by getting rid of fear. So all these things are it all ties together. So we don't have much fun as adults because we have so much fear. Children have a lot of fun because they have little fears until we start pumping them up with fear through schools and churches and other things we get them involved in. We're also very competitive in everything we do. That's another thing. Well, competitiveness is basically a way to manipulate with fear. You don't want to be a loser, do you? You want to be a winner. Well, now it's the fear of being the loser, and then it's the fear of, well, I'm not really good enough to win because there's other people better at that than I am. Therefore, what was me, and I'll just get the back of the line and try to disappear someplace. But those little strategies of children are still there. Now, you're 50 years old and you're dealing with things, but you're still carrying all that same fear baggage that you got all along your way from kindergarten on. Parents are always using fear. If you don't get this right, you'll get US. Banking. Or if you don't do that, this will happen. Or if you're not quiet, we won't go to Grandma's house. And they're always being threatened with one thing or another to try to get them to behave. But that's not really such a good way to try to get them to behave. You need to deal with that behavior in another more positive way rather than trying to deal with it by bullying, by using fear. There are other ways to approach it that aren't manipulative. So our whole life is people trying to manipulate us when we're small and when we're big, it's still the same. It's just different people for different reasons. They're trying to manipulate us, and we're trying to manipulate everybody else around us to make things come out the way we want. So we're in this sea of manipulators, constantly manipulating us marketeers, trying to get you to buy their products and things, and you're just in this sea of it, and it tends to wear down your confidence. It tends to make you feel like you just don't want to play. Like, I want to get off this merrygoround I don't like it here. This life is just not that much fun. I don't have any fun anymore. Well, that's why it's the fear that our culture kind of heaps on you from a very young age on. And people lack confidence. They lack the ability to laugh at themselves. Everything's serious because they might mess up or somehow do something wrong. And that's a terrible thing. Typical strategy is, well, I can't lose if I don't play. I can't mess up if I never get in the game, you see? So instead, we sit on the sidelines. We don't play, we don't get involved. We just kind of let life go by, and we feel kind of out of it, like, life isn't much fun. Well, it's our choice. We're making bad choices. Life should be fun, can be fun. And if you have some fun, you'll help other people have fun, too. Because fun is contagious. It's a good thing. And it's not really acting like a child, it's acting like a human being that's not full of fear. Well, children are like that up until five or six or whenever they start going to school. They learn to be more serious, focus and get it right.

SPEAKER_B

Yeah.

SPEAKER_C

Otherwise.

SPEAKER_B

When  you were talking about kids and dogs, it's like, yeah, try and use negative reinforcement on a cat. That works for you. Just never works. You can do it on a dog, you can do it on your kids. You can do it anyway. They just don't like that.

SPEAKER_C

No,  you can't. Matter of fact, if you get too negative with a cat, you're almost guaranteed they're going to do exactly what it is you don't want them to do.

SPEAKER_B

Or  worse. Much worse.

SPEAKER_C

That's  true. So that's kind of my key thoughts about having fun. Just being who you are, enjoying life and not being so serious, not taking yourself so seriously.

SPEAKER_B

One  of the things I do is I go onto Keith's Facebook page and look at all the silly memes that he puts up. Some of them are so good.

SPEAKER_C

Yes.

SPEAKER_B

He  likes to laugh or make others laugh.

SPEAKER_C

Yeah.  Keith is full of first. The first vacation in Europe that we took with Keith while we were doing an event, and we take a little vacation after. By the time Pamela got home, her sides were aching. It was from laughing so much with Keith. She just wasn't used to that much fun, that much laughing. But Keith is hilarious. He's a very funny guy. And some of those people at those word games, they're playing pun games and so on. They're not all native English speakers. Like, Olaf is one of the key players there with them, and his native language is German. But yet he's playing puns in English, and I'm always amazed at that. If you're speaking a foreign language, just to be understood is a good thing, and to do it well is fantastic. But then to get into the subtleties of puns and so on, that's pretty deep competency in a language. So I see that there's people of all sorts of different first languages that are all involved in Keith's word games, and I'm impressed with that.

SPEAKER_B

Some  of them are difficult. Think of an age thing. It could be well, us. Versus Canada. The thing. But sometimes it's right. Yeah, he's good. So fun.

SPEAKER_C

So  let's talk a little bit about Tom's Park then. It's a fun that's one of the ways that you can take kind of the fun route and the imagination route toward developing your intuitive side is the Tom's Park way. That's an alternative to the standard way, which is through meditation. Learn to discipline your mind so that you can put yourself in that intuitive state and stay there solidly. And you can do that with practice, but that's the meditation. But you can accomplish the very same thing by saying, well, I'm good at imagination. I can put myself in this imaginary space and then I can just let myself be there. In other words, let what happens in that imaginary space just take on its own rules. Do what it does, put yourself in it, but then don't control it. Let it flow however it does. And that ends up doing the same thing. Because if you go into imaginary, into imagination space and then let it flow, well, when you let it flow, you're taking your intellect out of the game. And when you take your intellect out of the game, guess what? You're in intuitive space, you see? So it's a way to get to those same states and to be able to do all those paranormal things, remote view and communication, mind to mind, and getting data out of databases without having to master discipline first. The discipline really gets mastered through your practice of imagining. You get better and better at imagining so that you can start an imagination theme and then let it go. Now, you probably won't do that on your first try, but that's why Tom Spark has a lot of fun things to do which helps you practice that imagination. And the more involved you get into the imagination, the more your daydream is multicolors and sight and sound and taste and all sorts of things going on. The more complex it is, the easier it is just to let it go, because the harder it is for your intellect to keep up with all that information. That's a lot of high information when you're doing a daydream. It's a very high bandwidth, and your intellect gets tired and quits and lets it go. So it's just another route to intuitive space. And a lot of people, that's how they do their paranormal. Things. That's how they start. They have some little metaphor that they used and they start with their imagination and slips right into an intuitive space and then off they go. So it's not like their whole experience is imagined. It isn't. The imagination is just the on ramp to get started. And with practice, you can have a daydream that takes on a life of its own. And everybody plays their own parts. You're not playing everybody's parts. And it's probably more fun practicing that than it is practicing meditation. So as we talk about fun, that's kind of the fun way to get into altered states of consciousness and explore the larger consciousness system. And the meditation way is probably the harder, less fun way. I don't know, maybe more direct, but not really. Most people, I think, probably have had experiences where they had a daydream and it just kind of started to fill in itself.

SPEAKER_B

Right.

SPEAKER_C

Our  night dreams do that. Things just happen in there. We don't make those up. They just happen. We get a data stream and that stuff happens. Well, that's the way it is with a daydream as well. You get that daydream and as soon as you start to let go, the larger conscious system starts sending you a data stream that's filling in all the parts for all the players. And you're just one player in something going on. And then those tend to be manipulated then by the larger consciousness system. Manipulated, but not through fear, to help you learn something. So daydreams can be very educational.

SPEAKER_B

Educational?  Well, certainly takes you into that intuitive. For me, it's always an intuitive heart space. It's not always for everybody. That's where I go. Which makes imagination and intuition it's usually a very expansive experience for me because it's all about the heart and then everything's perfect. Right. It's like, why are you trying to do something? It's just the way it's meant to be right now. Right. So I try so hard to change everything and it's right where I'm supposed to be.

SPEAKER_C

Look  at all those problems and realize they're only problems because of your perspective and the way you're looking at them. If you just change that perspective, all the problems would disappear exactly altogether. And then it's like, I'm having a problem. That means there's a lesson here. Oh, good, I'm going to learn this lesson.

SPEAKER_B

Right.

SPEAKER_C

So  then the problems turn into good things. Opportunities to learn a lesson always. And then learning lessons becomes fun. Not so much work, but fun.

SPEAKER_B

Just  like you can get into that perspective. Yes. Right. That's the issue. Getting retrospective. Yeah.

SPEAKER_C

Just  like walking that 10 miles.

SPEAKER_B

Yeah.

SPEAKER_C

It  probably wasn't as much fun the first time you walked it.

SPEAKER_B

I  would be bragging myself on my hands and knees if I could walk 10 miles when I started. That would have been pretty impressive. It didn't. Yeah. Had to work up to that. But yeah, even then, no, it's true. But the fun came from people from exactly what you were saying about to me, the water is always so soothing. I mean, it's sometimes very turbulent, but to me, it doesn't matter. It's like I'm walking, I'm in the sun. Not all the time, but especially this winter, apparently. We had the worst winter for darkness in was it 50 what started at 53 years? 57 years. It was like, wow, okay then. Yeah, we had pretty dark we just didn't have a lot of fun. And I think we create our own fun. We have to find our own fun from perspectives and from, I don't know, just enjoying what we do instead of trying to make it something we have to do. No, just enjoy it. Just play.

SPEAKER_C

And  then there's always that positive feedback because you're out walking and suddenly you can do it better than you did before, and suddenly your muscles aren't aching anymore like they were. It actually feels good. And you notice that and you say, oh, I'm getting better at this. Good.

SPEAKER_B

I  get anxious now. If I don't go out, it's like there's an anxiety level building. It's like, okay, I need to move, that's all. I just need to move my body. Interesting.

SPEAKER_C

Well,  if the weather is really bad and you don't want to go out, you can always dance.

SPEAKER_B

There  you go.

SPEAKER_C

You  can always dance. There's some music. No matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, if that music plays and I start dancing because it's music you have to move to.

SPEAKER_B

Yes,  I know those songs.

SPEAKER_C

It's  just the way it is. Put some of those songs on and just go move for a certain amount of time, and then that will make that kind of anxiety. I feel like I need to get out and do something.

And  yet when I see people that are always with their headphones on and their headsets on, and I think you're not even enjoying it because you're just so focused in your head and not enjoying what's around you. So I don't do that when I'm out, just because to me, it's like, I don't know, maybe I can't have too many things influencing me at the same time, but I just enjoy the freedom, I guess, of being out seeing the same people and enjoying everything about it. But yes, I did not start that way.

SPEAKER_C

Yeah,  well, there is a time and place for most everything. If you're going to be walking out into a natural world, then that would be the time to enjoy the natural world when you can't, or when there's something else going on, then you do something else. You kind of do the things that seem to make sense why you're doing them now. Today you'll see five teenagers sitting around a big table, and every one of them are staring at their and their thumbs are going like this. And to them, that's a social gathering.

SPEAKER_B

In  fact, they're probably texting themselves.

SPEAKER_C

Texting  each other.

SPEAKER_B

They've  lost their socializing communication skills. It's all in their thumbs.

SPEAKER_C

I  see that too. It's just amusing to us, to them.

SPEAKER_B

It  that's how they have if you part of Tom's Park community, there's like events that you put on so you guys can join each other and talk and share.

SPEAKER_C

Yeah,  we do that. We have a day in the park. I got one coming up in the future. Here a day in the park where we a bunch of people get together and everybody goes to Tom's Park and people discuss it. And sometimes if they have issues or things they're working on or things they're trying to figure out how to do or whatever, then it's a learning time. But it's also a fun time. And both kinds of stories are shared. People who just had fun and everybody has fun with them, then everybody enjoys that story. And sometimes it's more serious, but still fun in that, here's what happened to me. Does anybody have any idea what that means? What should I make of that? And often there's metaphors in there or other things that they just don't see, and other people can help them out. They're fun events to have, but it's a light hearted and a more playful way. Meditation is not playful. Meditation is more serious. You're learning discipline. You're learning to discipline your mind. But this is a more playful approach and works as well. The whole idea is to get rid of your intellect, to get your intellect to sit down and stop judging and analyzing and jumping in the way so that you can just open and connect. All the information is there. All the things to connect to is there. All you need is an intention and it's all there. You just have to get that intellectual part of you to just get out of the way. And going through the imagination is a more fun way to be able to do that. It still takes practice. Still takes practice. People don't just have great abilities to imagine when they start, but it's a lot faster than learning how to meditate. Yeah, and it's a lot more fun. It's a lot quicker too. You get to the point where your imagination just runs free pretty quickly. Whereas to be a really good meditator, you're talking years worth of practice. If you can just go sit down on a bench with a lot of people walking around and get into a really good meditation state, you've probably been meditating for some years to be able to do that. But having a daydream, you can have a daydream anywhere, almost anytime, and the fact that there's a lot of people and noise around just doesn't matter. You just get right into it because it's interesting. It's not something you're doing and it's not skills that you're honing, you're having fun. It's interesting. You're engaged in it. So that's what makes it so much easier and so much more fun. And it takes you roughly to the.

SPEAKER_B

Same  space and your mind doesn't know the difference between what you're imagining and what you're doing. So if you're fully in that space, then your mind is also not only free, but it's having fun, right?

SPEAKER_C

Yes.  And it's learning. And you are learning because when you're in that imaginary space and all the choices that you make, all the interactions and all the choices that you make now, again, this is not you imagining it through your intellect but letting that imagination run free when you get to that point. All those choices and things you do that you make there help you evolve or deevolve if you make poorly. So it becomes another space in which your interactions affect your evolution.

SPEAKER_B

Nice.

SPEAKER_C

It's  a learning space as well. So this space we call the physical universe, it's a learning space. And everything we do affects other people. And we make good choices, we evolve and bad choices, we evolve. But when you're in your imagination or in a dream, it's the same way that's you making choices. And there are results and consequences to those choices. It's just the consequences in a dream or in an imaginary space are much less constrained. They're much looser. The environment isn't so tied down to the rule set like it is here in this reality. So it gives you things that you could do and choices that you could make that you maybe would never get a chance to here.

SPEAKER_B

Like  flying and visiting.

SPEAKER_C

Things  you just can't do here very well.

SPEAKER_B

Go  through walls or it even gives.

SPEAKER_C

You  opportunities to say be nice to people or to abuse people that you wouldn't do here.

SPEAKER_B

Right?  Oh, that's true.

SPEAKER_C

Yeah.  You can go into a dream and take advantage of somebody I really dislike that person. They did this and that. And then you have this dream where you go and you take advantage of them and you embarrass them or hurt them or kill them or whatever else. You're making those choices.

SPEAKER_B

Right.

SPEAKER_C

And  those are all bad choices. You see, everything is kind of more available. Things that aren't available here are available there. And here you'd have to worry about being arrested for punching that person out or having consequences for that. Well, in your daydream, you don't necessarily have any consequences for that, you see? So it's easier to act out what's really under the hood. The truth of who you are can come out in ways that you'd never let out here because your image would squeeze all that stuff off and say no, we can't go there, we can't do that here. But in that imaginary space or even in the out of body space, you can do all kinds of ugly things that you wouldn't do here. And what that tells you that ugliness is in there, you need to own it because you're making those choices, and that's who you really are. Because in those spaces, what you do is a measure of exactly who you are. Remember, your intellect is where the image is. Your intellect now is sitting down and being quiet. So when you're in a dream space or in daydream, an intuitive space, the choices you make are a reflection of you, your quality at the core, they're right out of the being level. It's only when you get in that intellect that the image comes in and starts being an arbiter, oh, you can't do that, or you shouldn't do that, or you'd get caught if you did that, or there'd be repercussions if you did these other things. So you tend to act nicer here, more polite. We have manners and we have socialization skills here that are part of our image, but the real us is in those other realities. All the image stuff, all that politeness and so on, kind of disappears. So it's a place where you get to meet yourself. So in that way, it's a very important space for you to grow up in that you can't do here, that you won't do here. It's prohibited here. You prohibit it. Your own cultural norms prohibit some kind of those actions. So, yes, if in your daydream you smash people or do things that are ugly to get even, well, that's you, you are capable of that. Just because you don't show it here doesn't mean that that's not what and who you are. So, yes, it's a very valuable learning space. It's not only a different learning space, but you can learn different things there that you would never learn here. So it makes your evolution go a lot faster when you get into those spaces because it gives you opportunities to be authentic, to really be authentic. So that's a good space to be in, good space to learn in. And it should be fun as you do it fun. Well, we've made it all the way through an hour.

SPEAKER_B

I  know, can you believe it?

SPEAKER_C

Yeah,  just talking about having fun. And it's been fun, hasn't it?

SPEAKER_B

There  you go. Got a little serious at the end there, but true. Interesting opportunity to see our authentic self when we think about when we get angry or upset and what we think about at that time, never have I thought about death or killing somebody, but certainly I've thought just, I don't know, seeing my anger, but yeah, it's brought some interesting points up, but yeah, well, we do that.

SPEAKER_C

We  imagine that we're really going to squish somebody or embarrass them or unmask them or somehow create some difficulty for that person. It created difficulty for us, and we're going to get even. And all of that ugliness is in there. That's the authentic. You being ugly and self centered and not really caring about people, just caring about yourself. And sure enough, that's all in there. When you think thoughts like that, and it's good to get in those spaces and see that, because you'll learn an awful lot about who the authentic you is when you get into the out of body spaces or into these daydream spaces where the dream goes on by itself. It's the real you then. And that real you is often surprising to people, oh, no, I'm a nice person, and I'm kind and gentle and caring for all the people, but I'm going to smash them and I'm going to do this tear them to pieces. Well, that nice guy is an image, not necessarily a reality. Yeah, but we're here to have fun. But it's all fun, and particularly, you look back on it.

SPEAKER_B

Yeah.  You laugh at yourself then.

SPEAKER_C

Yeah.  It's like you crawling on your hands and knees for that 10th mile. But now you look back at it and you say, yeah, that was fun. You look at yourself and say, well, I'm glad I kept after it. I was learning. And it wasn't fun at the time, but it becomes fun in retrospect. They were good times. And, you know, we do that. We look back on times where we were very busy or very engaged or very whatever, and when we were in that, we were thinking, oh, I need a break. I need a vacation. I got to get off this treadmill. And we look back at it later, and mostly people say, those were some of the best times in my life, because I was so engaged and so connected with things that I didn't have time just to engage my self centeredness. I didn't have time. And then you look back and you see that those were good times, because you weren't engaging your self centeredness, because you just didn't have the time for that kind of petty stuff. You were just too busy or whatever, and they turn out to be really good times in retrospect, even if they were very busy and hectic times when you were in them. There's a lot of fun going on. We just don't see it, and we just don't let ourselves get involved in it. We stay off on the sideline and watch it or maybe imagine it. That's okay. So anyway, we've done it. This has been a fun program. All about fun.

SPEAKER_B

It  has. All about fun.

SPEAKER_C

All  about fun. And growing up. Growing up is fun to do.

SPEAKER_B

There  you go. All right. You've been listening to News of the Heart. We began to do The Heart of What Matters with Tom Campbell and Fun Consciousness. All right. Thank you, Tom.

SPEAKER_C

You're  welcome, Laurie.
