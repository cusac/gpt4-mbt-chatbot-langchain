Well,  we've made it to the Q A. That's good. Anyway, we'll entertain questions about pretty much anything relating to my big toe. We have one taker. The rest of you, if you feel like you have a question, just kind of get in line or make a little queue. Okay, well, let's get the first question. Tom? First and foremost, I'd like to thank you for all of the countless years that you've spent researching consciousness. You've opened up a number of doors for many people who not only didn't know such things existed, but it opened up the ability to be able to experience the way that you help us to understand it. And I applaud you, sir. Thank you. Having said that, my question is, what experiments have you done to disprove the notion that experiences in consciousness are not simply training the human mind, the gray matter, to access the dream state at will while awake? In other words, how do you know that the trips that you take are something outside of you rather than inside of you? Yes, sir. It's the inside outside data that requires some experience. And the reason that there's a problem with making a distinction is because what you get is data. You get information, you interpret that information, and you interpret that information as your reality. Let's say one of the sources of that data is your own imagination. So you have many sources of data. You'll have a source, say, the data stream you get from this reality. Maybe you're also connected to some other reality on an out of body or something else. You'll get that data stream. You may still hear a car honking out in the street or whatever. So you kind of get some of this reality, and you have an imagination that can make up data itself. And all of that data comes at you. And none of it has tags on it that says, this is where this comes from. You interpret that. You interpret the horn out in the parking lot because you heard that before, so it fits a pattern. So you put that in the parking lot. If you've experienced a lot outside of this reality, then you can put those things there. But the way you understand that it's not just you is through experiencing things that are extremely unlikely to be you. In other words, sometimes you will get information and you will see and get things that just aren't in you. It's very foreign to the way you think. It's very foreign to anything that you would make up or even guess. It just takes you a while. It's like, what is that? And then maybe even over days, you can maybe piece it together, come up you have hard times, come up with metaphors for things, because you don't have the metaphors you see. When we do that interpretation of the data, we have to do it in terms of what we know, what our experience is. So what our experience is is all this physical matter, reality experience that we've got. So when you get something that doesn't fit, you make up the best metaphor you can for it. You get like the closest approximation, like a pattern match. You match that pattern as well as you can and that's as good as you're going to get with it. Other than that, it's just I don't know what that was. You can't do anything with it. But sometimes I've gotten information from other entities, sometimes just putting it together from things I've seen. And I know that I didn't make that up because if I'd have made it up, it'd have been different. That wasn't what I expected, it wasn't what I anticipated. It was nothing at all like what I thought. And so you have those experiences and if you have enough of them, they find consistency. So that's why the horn is consistent with things you already know. If you explore other realities, they get eventually to be consistent with things that you know there. So that's how you separate it. But now that's not a sure thing, right? That's not a zero or a one. That's a probability. Well, that comes back to living gracefully with uncertainty. But the real clincher is that it doesn't matter. It really isn't important. The question isn't where did this come from? The real important question is what value is it? How can I grow from this? What is it about this that lets me see a bigger picture, understand things better, makes my life happy or whatever? That's the thing, because let's say something comes out of your own consciousness and it does make your life better. You understand something. It's an AHA moment for you. That's terrific. Would you discount that because it came out of your unconsciousness? No. And if you got something out of the larger conscious system and it just didn't make sense, you couldn't use it, don't know what to do with it. Well, toss it away. It's not valuable. So the real thing is what's valuable, what can you use and where does it come from? That's one of those things you have to kind of decide through your own experience where it comes from. Now, if things come from outside of you, you think they come from outside of you. You can test some of those, just like you can test things here. But you'll never get a zero or a one because all the data is mixed together and there really isn't any objective way to separate it. It's subjective data, so there is no objective separation. But in the end, it doesn't make any difference. It's all about getting things that you know. So if this nonphysical context is a context that works for you and you get information and there's connections there, well, then that's good. Now there's other things you can do, like remote viewing. So you can do a remote viewing and you see something, you go to some coordinates and you see a tennis court and you see two people playing tennis or whatever, and then you find out that indeed it was a tennis court. All right, now, how did you do that? You see, now you have something that isn't iffy you did get that information, it wasn't physical. You can get information that's not physical. That is very accurate. Now, is that some thing that your brain did? Well, that doesn't really make a lot of sense because how does it know about the tennis court? That's on some other country, someplace where this viewing was? So you kind of get those ideas, lets you know that your consciousness travels in a larger space than just the physical reality that we think of. So that's kind of a fact that we know. Couple that with your experience, and if you interpret your experience as visiting planets and other solar systems, that's your interpretation. And that may be just the way it seems to you. I just call that a metaphor. It's just your metaphor. It's your best pattern match to what you see. So I wouldn't say it's not a hard thing like, well, does that place really exist? It is. It really on the backside of the moon of Jupiter, which is what you think it is. It doesn't matter. It's really not important where it is. What value is it to you? So trying to put things in boxes as to exactly where they come from is often we do that because we want to be certain. We want to know, is it this way or is it that? Is it really that moon and Jupiter, or is it not? Is it someplace else? Those questions aren't really good questions. Those questions are generally put out by our ego. Our ego wants the certainty. And since it doesn't really matter because we're looking for value, then we live gracefully with the uncertainty. But there's a lot of things that are uncertain, but you deal with them anyway because your experience says that this is real, this is good information, this is helpful, and that's enough. It doesn't get any more real than you think it's real, and that's true about anything. So I think you're looking for kind of an objective evaluation where there can't be any because it's subjective data and it's an intuitive kind of call based on your experience, what you think and know. But when we gets right down to it, it's all metaphors. When I talk about the larger consciousness system as a big computer, it's a metaphor. When you talk about higher selves and free will awareness units and individuated units of consciousness, they're all metaphors. There's functions in consciousness that do those things. And we give the function a name. We call it a free will awareness unit. That's a name for the function that gets connected to the avatar. But it's just a function and a free will awareness is just a metaphor for that function. So we tend to deal that way with everything. So all reality is uncertain. This reality is uncertain. We think we have things that are certain in our lives, but there's very little that's certain in anybody's life. If you think you know who your parents are well, you grew up with them, they claimed you and whatever, but do you know that you weren't switched as a baby and nobody knows about it except somebody else? And you don't you see? Is that certain? No. I mean, the most basic things that we take as being fundamental truths are still uncertain. If we're looking if we're talking about objective facts, it's very hard to prove objectively anything. Well, you could take a DNA test and you could see and if you're compatible with your parents, that's good, but that necessarily proof either because there's certain group of people that would all get that same test. The DNA isn't that good that it's down to a single individual. There's a limited group of people that would have the same values that you might have anyway. Life is just like that. And it's better to accept it as uncertainty, use it as metaphors and don't take any of it too seriously. So when you feel like you just had a conversation with somebody that lives on the dark side of the moon in some other universe or planet, that's a metaphor. It's your best pattern match. It's a guess. And you shouldn't get too interested or too wound up around that being a fact as opposed to what did you learn from that? So a lot of the things I say, I wouldn't make them ones, things I've been, places I've gone I'm just giving you the best description I can. But do I know that that was exactly that way, that place? No, there's no way that you know. So one of the first things you learn is that you don't know nearly as much as you think you do. There's a lot of uncertainty in life and you have to realize that even not knowing who your parents are for sure because who knows what happened that you don't know. You just accept life's like that. So I know where you're coming from, though. Everybody would like to know for sure that what they're doing is real. Well, my thought is reality comes from the value, not from the place. Is it valuable to you? If it's valuable to you, then whether you imagined it or whether you saw it someplace else really isn't all that important. Could you say that those who have had, let's say, someone who has died on the operating table for five minutes and had the proverbial out of body, that whole experience is just their interpretation of the data stream? Yes, they'll get a data stream, they'll get out. I mean, everything's a data stream. When you die, you just hook into a different data stream. The reality you end up in after you get out of this reality is another virtual reality. It's a different rule set. Everything's a virtual reality. Consciousness is the only thing that's fundamental. A virtual reality means that it's a reality that you construct out of information. Well, just you'd have consciousness itself. But just for consciousness to communicate with another consciousness requires a virtual reality, inasmuch as you require communication protocols. So that you know what I mean when I make these noises. And I know what you mean when you make those noises. And we can't do that without some kind of communication rules. So we have to set up a rule set that defines meaning to sounds or to motions or to something so we can communicate. And that little rule set is kind of your zero order virtual reality, if you will. That's a rule set that determines limitations of what it is we can do. So everything's a virtual reality. You get into a different virtual reality after you pass from this one. And in that virtual reality, you get a data stream. You do that in all realities. And in that data stream, you may see the bright light that comes, and it's awesome, and it's love, and you feel connected with everything. And that's a real experience. And that experience for a lot of people is very important. It's life changing. And I'd say that makes that a real experience. And it doesn't matter, really, where the source is. But I would say it's just a data stream. And those NDEs, it's hard to tell. Again, you don't know for sure. But most of those NDEs, I think, are given that experience quite purposefully. It's not that they get out and they just happen to look at the right place and see that because that's what's there. They are given that information in their data stream because it's supposed to be an eye opener. It's supposed to be a life changer. It's supposed to be a message you take back and tell other people, and that's why they get it. And it's just data put in their data stream. See, every time we think we look out and see something, it's data in the data stream. So how do we know what it's real? You see what's real. There. Data in a data stream is real. We interpret it. Sometimes it's ourselves creating the data. Sometimes it comes from someplace else. So in a way, you could say, well, nothing's real. It's all just information. Or you could say, everything's real. It's information. Information is the only thing that is real. So I don't know. Have I helped? Oh, yes. Okay. I don't know if I've helped you or confused you. Oh, no. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, I took a long time on that because I think almost everybody in here has that same issue. I got a question about I've been trying to think and conceptualize to myself and feel what is infinity and what is that in relation to what I am? Okay, infinity. Now, maybe it's just because I'm a physicist and physicists do math that infinity is an abstract concept. It doesn't exist in mathematics. You can never get to infinity. You can only approach it. It's an impossible thing to get to, because if you actually got to it, you could always add something to it. Now, it wouldn't have been infinity anymore, you see? So you can't get there. This largest number isn't accessible. It's a concept. It doesn't exist. Now, anything that is real, that has real function has to be finite. It can't be infinite. If it's infinite, it needs infinite energy and infinite resources. Everything has to be infinite to support it. And nothing real is like that. Everything real has boundaries. Now, boundaries bring up another issue. If it has boundaries, let's say the larger consciousness system, all right? It's a real system. Therefore, it can't be infinite, because that's just an abstract concept. Infinite doesn't exist. Nothing real is infinite. So it's finite. Well, if it's finite, it's got a beginning and an end, right? It's got boundaries. Well, what are outside the boundaries of the larger consciousness system? Well, that's conjecture that there's something out there. There might be, but we'll never know, because we are consciousness. We're pieces of this system. And as pieces of this system, we can't get out of the system to look back at ourselves independently. We have to only have the view from the system of consciousness. So there's some things you just can't know, and that's one of them. You can't watch yourself being born because you haven't been born yet. That's why you can't watch yourself being born. There's a logical problem. We can't get out of consciousness to see what's outside the boundary, because we are consciousness. So we don't know, so we can speculate about what's outside. And in the books, I do some imaginative and some humorous speculation that our consciousness system is just one cell in a bigger system. But that's just making that up. That doesn't mean that that's true. Or you could say there's nothing outside there. There's just the void outside of the system. But that's making that up too. It's just you can't tell. So we can speculate if we like, but it's one of those uncertainties that you have to live with. We don't know what's outside those boundaries. And if anything is outside those boundaries, at real, that has boundaries too. It's just the word infinite. Now, a lot of people use the word infinite as something really, really big, just something bigger than you can imagine. And infinite is just the word for that. And that's fine. Then that's just a general use of the word infinite. One of the examples I give if I'm floating in an inner tube in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, that ocean looks infinite to me day after day after day. I look and I see the same thing in every direction. Well, it's not infinite. It just seems that way because it's so much bigger than I am. Well, the larger conscious system is so much bigger than we are that we kind of have this idea, oh, it's infinite. But if we just use that as a metaphor of really, really big, then sure, it's infinite in that sense. But if we use infinity in the more specific form, like math would use it or physics would use it, then that's an impossibility. Does that help you? I have a lot of people have a problem with the infinity thing because I'll say the larger kinds of system is finite and they don't like that because they want it to be infinite. But I think they're thinking really big, big beyond imagination. And that's fine. Use the word infinite and I say, well, it's not really infinite. It can't be infinite or it couldn't be real. And maybe it's just a math guy with the non math people that are having a conflict of semantical conflict there. Thank you.

SPEAKER_B

Tom.  Thanks. I think you've lowered my entropy both physically and non physically. My question here is do you think that these magnetic north and south magnetic monopoles are the same as the protons and electrons? If yes, how? If no, why? Because my thinking is that if it is different, the magnetic monopoles are more I mean, they are in random, more statistical and probabilistic. So do you think that it will affect the double slit experiment when it is viewed from a magnetic point of view? Because my thinking is that maybe JJ. Thompson misnamed maybe the submagnetic monopole as electron. So it could have been called magneticity instead of electron.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

I  don't think that you can say that protons and other charged particles, electrons or whatever, are the same as magnetic monopoles. Of course, if you look at Maxwell's equations, one of his equations is there are no such things as monopoles. Magnetic monopoles. That's one of his equations. They don't exist. Magnets have to come with a north and south pole. They don't come just with a south pole or just with a north pole. It's part of a binary logic, and you can't have one without the other, that they're necessary and that magnetic monopoles are an impossibility. Now, charge is different. Magnetic fields are different than just charged. But they're related, you see. So how do you get a piece of iron to become magnetic? Well, you take all the little molecules and you arrange them in such a way that all the plus sides are this way and all the minus sides are that way. But they're dipoles, right? They're little pluses and minus dipoles. And you take those molecules which happen to be able to be movable in iron, and they happen to be little dipoles. The molecule is longer than it is wide, I guess. And you get all those to line up. Now you have a magnet, but they're little dipoles. That's the fundamental idea with physics. So when you talk about a charge like a proton, that's different. Charge is not the same as magnetic. Now, here we have charges in the dipole. We have positive and negative charges in a dipole. And that does create a magnetic field because the field will go from one around to the other. It's a closed loop. So magnetic fields seem to always come in dipoles. And otherwise single units we call charge. So that would say that it's just how we name things. We've got a single unit. We call it a charge. We get those charge units and dipoles. Now we got a magnetic field. So maybe that's another semantic issue. But no, I don't think the scientists would agree with you. To say that you got a magnetic monopole is then a proton.

SPEAKER_B

I'm  employing an open skepticism to ask the question, because if we can have a magnetic charge, it's possible. Can we have a magnetic charge? If that's the case, then maybe what I was thinking, or maybe it's related. That's the way I'm looking at it.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

I  think saying a magnetic charge just doesn't that language doesn't compute in my sense of physics. I don't know that we can have a magnetic charge. I think charge is different. Now, if you have charge in a dipole formation, now you have a magnetic field, but you need the two together to make a magnetic field. So I'm not sure what your application is, but keep your skepticism going because I don't know everything. Don't let me reign on concept.

SPEAKER_B

I  think with respect to the magnetic dipole, I think there's an experiment that shows that you can separate them. See that you can separate them, and it can also recombine. That is some of the experiment I've read, tried to research into. So my thinking is that if that's the case, maybe it will affect the way we look at we look at the double slit experiment pretty much.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

That's  the way well, double slit experiment doesn't have to be done with charged particles. It could be done with anything.

SPEAKER_B

Yeah,  I understand that. Okay. One more question. Can someone use his or her intent to disable your free will awareness unit?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Okay.  Can you use a free will intent to disable? Yeah, somebody's somebody else's. Can you overrun somebody else's free will?

SPEAKER_B

Yeah.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

With  yours? Yes, that's possible. You can do it here physically, and you can do it just with intent. There's nothing that forces you to be nice. Being nice has to be a choice that you make. So you can use your intent to heal. You can use your intent to hurt. We have those people who are healers, and we have those people who what do voodoo or whatever else, they use their intent to hurt people. And all of that is real. Yes, you can do that.

SPEAKER_B

And  how do you inoculate yourself from.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

How  do you protect yourself from that? Yes, the first way you can protect yourself from that is be fearless. Inasmuch as you have fear, that negative intent will connect with you, and it connects with you through your fear. So your fear kind of connects you to it. And that's why people who do that kind of thing, who do that negative work, part of their process is to frighten you first. That's why they send you the little doll with the thing in it. It's to frighten you. You see, it's not that that doll means anything at all in their process. The process is all mental, but that frightens you. And once you're frightened, that's a connection. Now you've got a direct line to that, and that makes it easy for them to affect you. So that's, number one, become fearless. If you have no fear, they've got no way to actually access you. It's just like you're slippery and everything slides off. Nothing sticks. You don't accept any of the energy, and it won't hurt you. And as much as you're fearful, you're an easy target. And the more fearful you are, the easier a target that you are. So that's the first thing. The second thing is you can use your own intent if you like to. Again, it's metaphors. You can make metaphors that protect yourself. But now you have to realize when you make a metaphor, like you can surround yourself with light, and in your mind, your intent is that nothing nasty can come through that barrier. It's a block against all things nasty. That's your intent. What you're really doing there isn't necessarily surrounding yourself with light. That's just a metaphor. That's a picture we give to it. What you're doing is making an intent to refuse any data or information that's negative. We imagine that as the thing of light, but that's the intention. Your intention can open up data links or close data links. So when you remote view, you see those people in the tennis court, but you don't see those people in the tennis court all the time. It's not like you see everything going on in the world at once. It'd be too confusing. You open up that data link because you have an intention to see that. And then when you're done, you close that and you don't see it anymore. So intention opens and closes these data links, and that's when you have that idea of protection. You're basically making an intent to not accept anything that isn't for your betterment, anything that's going to help you grow, anything that's going to pull you down or whatever. You just don't want it. But you have to do that without being afraid of what it is you don't want. You see, if the reason you're making that protection is because you're terrified about something, then it's not going to work too well because you're making a protection intent good. But you're also making a big, bright target not so good. So you have to be able to have those clear intents, no fear of what you'll accept, what you won't, and just not worry about the worry will do you in. If you worry about what might happen, you'll help create that to happen. If you fear it, you help make it. But all that is very real.

SPEAKER_B

Yeah,  because I saw one guy, a friend of mine who did a neuroscience, I think he gave a talk at Ted where he designed some instrument where you can connect your brain and to your arm. And then when you move it and you connect to somebody's arm, you can take control of that person's arm. So taking away that person's free will to make the motion.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yeah,  hypnotists will do that too. Right. But it's a little different thing. What you're just describing would only work if the people involved were open to it. If the person who was having their arm moved really didn't want to play that game, they could block it. So it's not that they can't block it, it's that they don't want to. They're cooperative. So hypnotism is similar. You can hypnotize somebody and you can tell them, oh, I have a bright red apple for you. Here, take a bite. And it's really an onion. So they take that onion and they bite it, and they go Good. Yeah. Well, they're hypnotized. Right? Well, they know that they're biting an onion, but they have the sense they have an urge, they have a need to cooperate, to do what they're asked to do, to be a part of it. So you might say that their will has been weakened to the point that now they feel obligated to I wouldn't say play along, but to be a part of what's going on. They want to do that. It's not that they're really forced to do that, but they do. So that's kind of how hypnotism works. It deals more with your attitude and will than it has to do with actually mechanically making your taste buds taste apple when they taste onions. It's not really that way. So I'd say if that happened, my guess would be I'm just guessing. I wasn't there.

SPEAKER_B

But  my guess actually, maybe I'll send you the video. Actually, he sent it to me, and he was spoken test we talked about a week ago. So I said maybe I should, because in the statement, they took the other person's free will away because they took control of his hand when the other person is moving the other hand.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

I  would be very skeptical of that. I'd be very skeptical of know you can see something on video, almost anything. Thank you. Yeah.

SPEAKER_C

Hi,  Tom.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Hello.

SPEAKER_C

Thank  you for being here and having us here. I have a question about the IEOC. Can an IEOC individual unit of consciousness exist without being measured or observed within PMR or Npmr in other. Words, does an IOC always need an observer? And can it be a thing in itself? Or is it always supposed to be a measured phenomena?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

I  don't know if that no, your individuated unit of consciousness isn't in this reality, right? It's in the reality of consciousness. It's not in this reality. So you won't observe it here. Now, how do you observe it if you're out there? How do you meet other people who are individuated units of consciousness? Yes, you can observe them, but what you observe is your own interpretation of the data. So you get data stream from something. Well, we immediately then assume that if it's from something, it's from a being. And then when we assume it's a being, we see it with a head and two arms and legs because it looks like us, because that's our definition of a being. So now we see ourselves talking to this humanoid shape. Well, we've given the shape and all of it from our interpretation of the data because we're actually having a conversation. And you don't have conversations with rocks or other things. It has to be a bean. And then the being looks like us. If it's not a friendly conversation, then maybe the bean has two heads and fangs. We can make a different interpretation. So the observation is really in the mind of the person that's making the observation. It doesn't necessarily mean that that is what you're dealing with. That's part of this question of is it real or not? You see? No. The idea that it's a man or a woman in a white dress with a purple robe and flowers in her hair, that's not necessarily real. What's real is that you've made a connection with somebody and that's the image that they give to you. That's the feel that they have is that image. That's what's really real to you. Now, the other way that you can get that data is that the data is given to you. The conscious system can give you data that you're going to interpret as a woman in a white dress with flowers in her hair because that's the data they give you. And now it's not so much your interpretation that you're giving it. It's the interpretation, really, that's sent to you. You're just interpreting because you've got that image that's a perfect pattern match for you. You can imagine a woman in a white dress with flowers in her hair. It's easy, you see? So you get that data and you get it exactly right. So in that case, you described the data accurately. The other case, you made that data up because that was a best pattern fit to what you got. So we have to be a little careful about what we subscribe as real or not real. The information is real. The interpretation is our own.

SPEAKER_C

So  I guess this answers my other question was about solipsism the concept of that you're the only consciousness that exists. And whatever you observe or measure is the reflection of the data stream that you're getting, I guess, answers my question.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yeah,  I would not subscribe to that because I see the utility in lots of people interacting. If it's all just one, then I'm the only one. And all of you guys just part of my thing, right? You're just here to entertain me. I'm here to talk, and you're here to pretend you're the audience. But then every one of you feels like that too. So you feel that we're all just here so that you can get up and ask a question and whatever and you're doing your thing. Well, there doesn't seem to be. Each one then, requires a whole Universe to support them, right? Every consciousness needs the whole planet, the whole universe, to support them because that's their Universe to play in. So that's a universe per consciousness seems like a very inefficient way to run a game. A universe per consciousness. And besides, if you're just you and by yourself and nothing else, then it's very hard to learn much or grow much. Because where you learn and grow is by interaction, by running into things that are not like you, things that are different from you, ideas that you never thought of before. That's the kind of thing that stimulates growth. So now I can see something that's a lot more efficient. And that would be a virtual reality with all kinds of beings in it all interacting and challenging each other with their stuff, with their meanness, as well as with their kindness. Challenge you all over. So now I can see how we all feed each other. We're all each other's teachers and we're all each other's students that I see. And that makes sense because now it's very efficient. Now you have all of these individuated units of consciousness all interacting. And a system doesn't have to plan a whole universe and then play with them in that universe. They create their own interaction. And because you have all these people with free will interacting, the possibilities are endless. Huge possibilities. If it's just you and all the rest of the world is there to serve your whim, then it seems to me you are in a very sterile situation. That probably wouldn't be likely. So in a theoretical sense, you could have it either way, right? I mean, in theory, it could be that everybody's in their own universe, but it wouldn't be practical. For what purpose? To what end? So again, it's another one of these things. Theories are easy, but you have to find theories that actually work. And I have a very similar argument with the many worlds theory in physics. There's a many worlds theory that says it's similar to that, right?

SPEAKER_C

Yes.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

That  every time you do something, another universe gets spread off. Okay, so I decide that I'm a scratchist instead of doing this. Two universes just got birthed. Two complete universes full of all of us just got birthed because I decided to do this instead of that. Well, to me, that isn't efficient. That's a very inefficient way to run a reality. And it's not that it's impossible. It's not that, theoretically, that couldn't be done. It's just it doesn't make any sense. Why would you want to do that every time an atom changes state? Well, now there's a universe that has that atom in it in this state and a universe that has that atom in it in that state. Every time a molecule vibrates or gets bumped, you can see the numbers of universes you need for every change is just outrageous. Now you need trillions of trillions of trillions of universes, and that number would be growing geometrically because now all these trillions of universes are all doing things, and they're all generating trillions of universes. And, yeah, as a theory, you can see that. Yeah, theoretically that's a possibility. But practically, it just doesn't fly. It doesn't make any sense. So that's the same thing I have with the Solopism, is that, yeah, theoretically, it's a possibility that it's just us and everything else is being imagined because you can see how that's a possibility. But it doesn't make any practical sense to me that a system would be that way. And because this is a real system, a real system has boundaries and a real system has limited resources. That's the nature of a real system, doesn't have infinite resources. And if you've got limited resources or, say, finite resources, because you're a finite system, you can't be making trillions of billions of universes every microsecond, because that's not practical. You have to be efficient, which is why this is a probabilistic virtual reality, because that's efficient than all those ground up calculations you see. That's why a lot of my theory follows along a principle of you want to get the biggest result out of the smallest investment. That's called parsimony in computational circles. So you want a parsimonious result. And the same idea comes across as Occam's razor that says the thing with the fewest number of assumptions is likely to be more fundamental. It's the same idea simple, elegant, and efficient. And that might be fundamental or real. If it's not simple, if it's hugely complex, it's not really elegant. All this computation has to be done to do it. Then it's not likely to be fundamental. It's likely to just be hypothetical, but never be real because the real world has limits and restrictions. So that's sort of my take on that. But it's not a zero or a one. But the fact that one way is very efficient and the other way is very inefficient makes me think that a real system that's evolving would have to be the efficient one. The inefficient one would never evolve. It would self destruct under the weight of its own needs, its own resources.

SPEAKER_C

Yes.  Hi, Tom. Hello. I had this time, this question. Are other reality frames almost identical to us or just similar? Well, I have been in other reality frames that are very similar to us. Never been in one that was identical to us, and I've been in some that were nothing at all like us. So identical would be the only one. I've never seen I've never seen one that's exactly like this. So no parallel?

XXXTom CampbellXXX 

Yeah, I've never seen any that look like they were parallel universes of here. No, never. They all seem to be things that have evolved on their own path. Now, sometimes, many times, the rule sets are very similar. And I think that's because it's not easy to come up with a rule set that's stable to come up with a rule set. A rule set is all the rules by which stuff can interact, and then you have initial conditions, and then you punch the run button, and that creates a simulation. That's the virtual reality I'm talking about. There's not that many sets of initial conditions and rules that will end up with a reality that's stable. That's a place that can spawn or evolve things like us, avatars, so that consciousness can come in and make choices, you see. So I think that's why often the rule sets are very similar, because there's not that many ways you can do that. It's a tough thing to do. And I don't even know that this one is stable. I mean, after all, one day we're all supposed to be reduced to what, hydrogen gas or just ray strand them? Elementary particles? Second law of thermodynamics, that one day the whole universe will be disordered. Well, that's not really stable, but it's stable long enough for all this evolution to take place, to give platforms for consciousness to have avatars so that they can make choices. So it works. Probably not long term stable in that sense, a long term being hundreds of billions of years, but long enough. So I think that's a hard thing to do to replicate, though. I mean, yeah. Now, we could of course, you can take a it's digital. Whenever you have a digital reality, it's very few constraints. You could take our reality at some time, take a copy of that, put it over here in another processor, and start it up again. Right. We wouldn't make the same choices. There'd be different choices, and the whole thing would end up evolving off on its own path. So by the time you got to it, years later, it'd be significantly different. So evolution is just like that. There's a large degree of randomness in evolution. Have another question. In one of another talks that I saw, you talked about how the big cheese made his rounds in this reality frame. So that makes a reality frame to have certain relevance or not, I don't know. Yeah. What does it mean that he made his rounds here? I don't remember saying he made his rounds, but I'll try to. Sounds like a doctor, right? Going to see all these patients? No, I got it more like a tour of duty or something. At the end of the day, I called the Big Cheese. Of course, that's just a name I gave it because I'm trying to keep people from taking it all too seriously. I don't want people to get wrapped up around the Big Cheese who happens to be what I said was like the CEO of End Division, that sort of thing. Well, I make that ingest because I don't want people to get too serious about it. But it is an entity that has some authority, if you will, over all the things going on in End Division. It's kind of got a responsibility. Whenever you have a system, any sort of system other than a random one, whenever you have an ordered system with lower entropy, there needs to be management. If you have rule sets, then the rules get broken sometimes. Not necessarily the rule set that evolved the reality, but we have rule sets. Like in this reality, entities just cannot come barge in here and create havoc. Just like you wouldn't let the teenagers come into the third grade class, right? And steal the third graders lunch pails. You just wouldn't allow that. That's forbidden. So we have rules like that too. And those rules need to be one made up and find good rules rather than bad rules. And that takes some thought. And they also need to be policed and the sensitive people break them, that there's some consequences. And just like real life, sometimes they get broken and there are no consequences. They get away with it and sometimes not. So you need administration, if you like, because you have rules, and rules require administrators. And this Big Cheese, then, is a metaphor for that function of management that needs to be in a very complex system. You can't have a complex system that doesn't have any oversight, doesn't have any management. It will have a tendency to deevolve and disintegrate because the rules will tend to be broken. And as all the rules go away and so on, then you end up with anarchy and then you end up with a situation that's very hard to learn from and it just isn't good. So you kind of need to keep the rules. But he's an entity now. Yeah. Well, what's an entity again? I said to an earlier question that we communicate with something, we turn it into something looks like us and an entity looks like us and acts like us. This entity could be just another well, it is in nutsense, just another piece of the larger consciousness system. This is operating at a different level than us. So it's like us call ourselves entities, but we're just pieces of the larger consciousness system. So we could say that it's just the larger consciousness system doing that function. We could also say it's the larger conscious system doing our function too. It's all one thing just doing all these various functions. We can look at it that way. So when I say it's an entity, I say that in a general way. Not that he lives in a house and goes home to his wife and kids and dog and that kind of stuff. Not quite like that, but just some sort of metaphor of an awareness of what's going on and a mission to keep it under control, to keep the rules working and to see that everything is okay. So that's the sense of an entity. I break these things out functionally. There's a function that needs to be done. That's a management function. Well, if I'm going to communicate with people from this planet I have to use words like that function is management because that is the closest I can get to it. But it's just the function that needs to be done. The free will awareness unit and the individuated unit of conscious are all functions that have to take place. There's all reasons why that function has to be there. And then we name them and make entities, separate entities out of them so that we can talk about them. Otherwise we can't talk about it if we don't do that because we have to talk about things in terms of our experience which is what we get here. So everything has to be translated back to this physical reality's experience base. That's why we have entities and not just abstract pieces of the larger consciousness system because that's too hard to talk about for us. We don't get that entity. We kind of get. So the entity is only a very general term for a function that has to be done. And in the times that I have been in other reality systems I've noticed that there is a management function. That happens, things happen that obviously there's somebody in charge and there's different things in charge, different places. You not only have N division but you got N plus one division and N minus one division and then there's some kind of management function above that. So that's about all I've seen. Whether there's any management function abunding out, I have no idea. Never had any contact with that. But I've had at least those two levels. And generally I think in consciousness it's a very flat organization. There's not a lot of hierarchy involved in it. It's a very flat organizational structure because the idea is you let everything go to be however it is as best you can. But you do have to have certain rules and those rules are very general and there's a lot of leeway mostly in those rules. And it isn't until something gets really critical that anything's generally really done about it. Because after all, this is free will. It's not us free will interacting with each other. If somebody's constantly moving our piece around on the board to suit themselves because there's a lot of rules. You have to pretty much be able to do whatever it is that you do, whether it's good or bad. And that's okay. So there's a minimum amount of hands on, but there's a lot of nudging and help. Hey, Tom, I just wanted to talk a little bit about reincarnation. A couple of questions that I had on that subject were basically, when you die, is there like a length of time or is it instant before you come back? Is that variable? Is it something you decide to do? And also, is it possible for you to be back at the same point twice or multiple times? So you split down and maybe have somebody in this room? Could also be me, and I guess that's where I'm coming from. Okay, first question is what's the time like on returning? That's up to the individual. I have lots of individuals that say that they're not coming back here. No way you're going to get me back to this place. Because they're having bad experiences, they're struggling, they've got a lot of fear, they got a lot of ego. Life has not been fun. And basically they have that attitude. And their question is, do I really have to come back here? And the answer is no, you don't. But you probably will. See, because even though you think this is a terrible place, that's mainly because you're making it a terrible place. It's not so much it's terrible on its own. It's terrible because what we bring to it, we collectively bring to it is why it's so terrible. So once you leave here, you get to come back when you're ready, when you feel like you've digested what you've just done, learned all the lessons you can learn, figured out where it is you think you need the most work. And then you kind of try to get a situation that is going to stimulate the learning that you need to learn. So that may take time. So the more times you've been around the block, then the more time it takes to plan the next one at the low end of it. You haven't been around the block too many times. You jump in, you jump out. Doesn't matter. You're just getting experience. You don't have enough experience yet to be deciding. You need to work on this. Instead of that, you need to work on everything. So there's differences there. Let's see, that was one part of your question. How long does it take? It just depends. Whenever you want to. Can we reincarnate into the past or into the same place? So could you split down and be in two different places? Could you do it twice? Could you incarnate in two different avatars, separate experiences at the same time? Yes, of course. The individuated unit of consciousness can have two free will awareness units. Okay, and they can be down there at the same time. They can even be interacting. They can even be mother and daughter or father and son or brother and sister or whatever. Or they may be on opposite sides of the planet. It depends. See typically it's one individual, one at a time. And the reason for that is it's more efficient in learning that way. Learning is cumulative. So what you learn now will change what you can learn the next time. So that's why it's not equivalent to send. Let's say if you could duplicate yourself and have ten of you all go out and each one of you go through one grade, you do kindergarten and your other one did this. And it doesn't work that way because you got to do kindergarten before you can do first grade. Before you can do third grade, you got to accumulate serially because you can't take all of those unrelated things and bring them together. So because it's cumulative, serial works better than parallel. But certain learning situations parallel is wonderful because you really can get an in depth connection between somebody. There was a result that Donna brought up to me once that Weiss, right? Dr. Weiss. He talked to a lady who seems to have had three incarnations here at one time and it was on three sides of an issue. She was a Jewish woman who had been snatched up by the Gestapo. She was a member of the Gestapo and she was yeah, just a regular soldier in the war. So she saw this conflict which was evidently a very significant thing for her from these different viewpoints, you see, because you're still kind of communicating, you're taking all this data in, you've got an empathic connection with all the other parts and that helps you see things in a different light. Oftentimes I've seen two incarnations at the same time between people who are related, like father, son, mother, daughter particularly if they had issues with any of those let's say they had issue with an overbearing. They were very overbearing as a parent. They're very forceful, very demanding on their children. Well when they come back and do their review they say, yeah, that's tough love, that has to be done that way. Well, giving them a father son connection, you see, now it gets both viewpoints at once and then they can see what it's like on the other side of the fence, what that other person feels like when there's being dominated or being dominating. You see either way and it's an AHA moment they learn something. So that's why those kind of close relationships can be the same oversold doing a double because it's a lesson they need to learn and that lesson is best learned from double perspectives. Okay? So it's not often most of the time it's single because now you've done two that help each other learn. But typically if you're just here to learn from a situation. You need to learn that because the next time you're going to be at a different place and you'll learn different things, different ways. And trying to do all of them at once doesn't help. If you sent out 1000 incarnations all in the same time and brought them all back, you'd maybe only get the value out of as much as you would have out of one or two or three. It's just not efficient to parallel process something like that. Okay, great. Thank you very much. You're welcome.

SPEAKER_C

Hi,  Tom. Hello, everyone. I don't know how to ask this question, but as I was sitting here, he actually part of my question. He asked, but then other stuff just started coming into my head. So I'm sorry if I just am rambling, but my pet came to my mind when I was sitting here. Do animals also get reincarnated and can they come back as people?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Sure,  that can happen. Doesn't happen real often, but it can happen. Animals are conscious just like we are. Anything that has a finite decision space, in other words, can make choices. It can decide to do this or that. If it's a choice making entity, that's consciousness. That's what consciousness does. It makes choices. So, yes, your dog or cat or whatever can make choices. You've seen it make choices and you've seen your cat and it looks at you and it looks at the table, and it looks at you and looks at the table and it's thinking, can I get to the table and get that food and then get out of here before she gets from there to here. You can see the wheels turning and you know they're thinking and they're deciding what it is they're going to do. Sure. And animals are doing the same thing we're doing. They are making choices and growing up the quality of their consciousness based on the choices. They're just doing it at a different level with a lot smaller decision space. So consciousness can come in all kinds of sizes and sorts. Right, so they're doing this at a simpler decision space. So, yes, they can. And if they do this and progress and progress to the point that it's no longer that challenging, they've outgrown that form of challenge, well, then they can do something else, you see, they can come back as some other form. You can play. You can be the player for any kind of avatar. It's just whatever you're ready for. If you're ready for the human experience, it doesn't matter that you've last time you were Lassie. Lassie's pretty clever. He always somehow gets Timmy out of the lassie probably gets a go at the human form, but it's not like that happens all the time. And that all animals have to progress up and go through that and so on. Everybody's just working at wherever they are. It's just a possibility that you can move on. It's also not necessary that you come back here into this particular virtual reality. There are other virtual realities, and if you want to get out of here and go to a different one, you can. Most people don't, because they kind of know the ropes here. They know how it works, they're familiar with it, and usually you're better at a game if you know how the game works and you're familiar with it. So people tend to come back because this is what they know. You could go to a different reality frame, but if you have no experience there and the rules and the culture and everything's totally different, you're going to be a fish out of water for a while until you catch on. So that's the choice. That's why most people end up coming back here. Even the ones that don't like it here, that goes away after a while. It's not very long before that's kind of a bad dream. And then after that, they get really bored. Then after that, it's like, well, what do you want to do with your life? And then it's like, well, let's get back to work. And here they are again. So it doesn't matter how much they really don't want to come back here. That doesn't last very long.

SPEAKER_C

That  kind of answered my next question because I'm sick of this place.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

You're  really sick of this place.

SPEAKER_C

I've  done my part. I feel like I'm yeah, really. I feel like I'm bored. Like this is Mario Three all over again for me. I know where all the hidden mushrooms are. I'm  ready to start off well. You may get another situation. You probably will have a situation here that's just more likely, but it could be someplace else. But you have experienced what you've experienced because of the situation that you're in, and you may decide to do something dramatically  different, which is why I feel like I'm done, because I describe myself as someone who just wants to just always do and help other people. So in my past life, I was probably like a real witch or something. I was mean because now I just feel like whatever. Literally, I've been through a lot, like so many people have, and I just feel like I've done my good deed for me being here. I'm opening up a shelter for homeless people, literally. I don't know what else I am to do. So when I'm transitioned, I want to go somewhere else and plant a garden somewhere else. That's just how I feel.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

That's  fine. You have free will. So that means that nobody ever tells you what to do. You have free will. And never will anybody say, you have to do this. Never. You will always have a choice. That's what we are as consciousness. We make choices. And if we don't have free will, then the whole system falls apart. It doesn't work. It only works if we have free will. Free will is necessary for. Consciousness. And consciousness is necessary to express free will. The two of them are logical set. They don't come separately, consciousness and free will. So you will always be able to say no or yes to anything, and you'll be given choices. If you say no, you'll say, what else you got on the menu? What else can I do? And they'll give you those things, and eventually you'll make a choice or you'll try something, and that'll work, and so on you go.

SPEAKER_C

And  if it doesn't work, then I'm zapped back here, right?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Not  unless you want to. You see, you go where you want to. So everybody's here as a volunteer, not as forced labor. It's a place to learn, but you'll feel the need then to learn to grow up. Just hanging out is not enough. You need to make progress, and you know that. And there may be various places where you can make progress, and then any one of those are fine. Everybody in the whole consciousness systems, they're all doing the same thing, from the dogs and cats and bumblebees and monkeys and to people and other kinds of critters and things that are in other reality systems. Everybody is just trying to grow up and become love because that's what it's all about, you see. And sounds like you've been pretty successful this time, so good. But, you know, there's always something to learn, there's always something to do, something to grow from. So I doubt that you're really done. You will probably meet some challenges. Anybody who says, all right, I solved all the challenges, is really asking for something. Thank you.

SPEAKER_C

Hi,  I have a couple of questions. My first question is to kind of tie with the same subject of different realities. So when we hear people bound by space time physical limitations, when we hear about entities from other realities, sometimes it may seem that they have it easier just because they have less limitations. When you compare when people come here for certain not people, sorry. Consciousness comes here for certain challenges, how much more complicated is our reality from others? Do they have it easier?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yeah,  it's similar. Okay. Now it depends when you say complicated or challenging. I have been to some realities that I would say were much more challenging than this one. And the reason for that was they had deevolved a great deal, and it was basically what you would expect out of a reality system where everybody was looking out for number one and there was no trust, there was lots of fear everywhere. There was very little love anywhere. That would be a really big challenge to deal with. So it's a place that kind of went bad and is still struggling to turn around. So I'd say that's a much more challenging here. This makes this like a cakewalk compared to that. We're all doing good and full of love and peace, but it's all relative. I've also been places that have been a lot more peaceful and loving in here. So it kind of depends. You go to a place that's very peaceful and loving and it feels good, but you find out you don't learn as much. You go to a place that's too challenging, and you don't learn as much either because you're overwhelmed with the challenge. So you tend to find a place that just kind of suits you, that is not too hard, not too easy. If it's too easy, you just kind of kick back and things go by and you end up, after it's all done, of wasted most of your time. You weren't challenged enough, so you end up with something that works. And that's part of the process after you die here is to find out what's going to work best for you and then go there. Now, this reality that we're in works really well for all sorts of people. It's not really on the scale of evolution. It's not like it's all peas and light and there are very few challenges. It's not like it's all death and destruction. It's kind of floating around in the middle. And there's lots of challenges here because we could evolve either way. We can evolve or deevolve. So it's kind of an interesting place with a lot of potential. So that's why it's a popular place.

SPEAKER_C

My  next question was going to be on a different subject about the double fluid experiment. I am not a physicist myself, but I spoke about this experiment with a person who is in physics. He's done Andronic collider and he's working with particles. And what he explained to me is that the reason why let's say an electron acts as a particle if there is a detector, and as a wave if there is no detector is because the only way to detect an electron is to interact with it, because of how small it is.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yes,  a lot of physicists believe that, but it's not true. It's a common belief. If you took a whole bunch of physicists together and asked them that, most of them would probably say that. And the reason they would say that is that is a way to try to make it all seem physical. What you're really doing there is it's the detector has to interact with the particle to detect it. Right. So that's something that's a problem. Well, I don't know if this is the first one, but in 2000, an experiment was done. I think it's Scully et al. And I've shown it in some of my work, and it was a touchless experiment. They did detect, but they never touched the particle with any energy at all.

SPEAKER_C

Is  it the one where you used mirrors with lasers?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yeah.  No. What it does is you have two particles come in and they hit a piece of plastic that has a property that when the particle hits, it creates a pair of entangled particles. So you end up with two entangled particles. So they let one set of particles go, do the double slit experiment. The other set of particles that are completely different particles, they do the detection different particles, so they can detect by where these particles go, what these two particles, where they came from, because both of them contain which slit. They came from both of those. So it was a touchless kind of experiment so you could determine what slit a particle went through without ever touching it with any energy at all. And what they found out was what they expected to find out, and that was that the detection makes no difference whatsoever. Now, they had already found that out years before, even back in the early 20s. They came to that conclusion for two reasons. One, they looked at the detection methods, and the detection methods were such that there wasn't enough energy transfer to have any effect. It was negligible, so they didn't feel that that was it. And secondly, that if they left the detectors running but didn't record the data, it worked just the same. So detectors with their energy continued to run, but you don't record the data. It still works because there's no data. That's why they decided that information was the key. It was the which way information, not the detection process, but the which way information is the key to it. But a lot of physicists still hold on to that idea, even though, what, in 2000, we're all we're at 16 already, right? We're 16 years later from that experiment. Physics students still hold on to that because that makes sense to them as a physical explanation, and nothing else does. But right from the beginning, we've known that that's not the case. That's really not the way it works. But it's a belief that's held dearly by a lot of physicists. So I would just disagree with your friend that that's the way it works. And I think if he dug into it, he would find that other quantum physicists would do that, because, see, physics is very specialized field, just like medicine. You go to a brain surgeon for brain surgery. You don't go to your GP for that because the GP wouldn't do very well. And it's the same thing with physics. You have particle physicists, and you have quantum mechanics, and you have all sorts. There's dozens of different specialties inside of physics. And the people that are physicists that are not in quantum mechanics theory, they just really don't know. Just like the GP doesn't really know all the details of brain surgery. He doesn't have to. It's not his thing. And every doctor can't know all the details of every specialty. It's just too much. So most physicists don't know, really the details of quantum theory because it's not really what they do. All they get is the kind of the scuttle butt and the side stuff and what they got in graduate school and that sort of thing, but they don't get the in depth stuff. See, if that were the case, if it were physical and it was just a matter of those detectors, energy interfered with it, well, it's a physical process. It's simple. You send the energy in, it somehow messes with that particle, and that's what causes the decoherence. Well, if it were all physical, why would you have Bohr and Heisenberg and Planck and all of these people making quotes know, if you don't think this is totally foreign and outside of everything you ever thought of, then you just don't understand it yet. If it wasn't really that big a deal, oh, it's just these particles do that, and that's the way it works, then it wouldn't be such a big deal. But it is a really big deal. And that's why you have Feynman. You have Feynman saying that nobody will ever understand this because the fact that it interfered with the detection was a problem. Feynman knew that that wasn't it, or he would have said, oh, I understand it. Look, it's just this detection does that. Well, he didn't. Feynman said, nobody will ever understand this. And he was a very hotshot quantum mechanics theorist. So that's common belief, but not accurate. And if your friend looks at Calgary workshop, I put that slide up of that experiment along with the title and who did it. Yeah, you can look it up. It's a delayed choice quantum eraser experiment. So not only do they use the entangled particles, so they don't have to touch the ones that they're measuring, but then after they've collected the which way data from the tangled pair, they race it. After the primary pair have already are done, they give a longer flight path they call idlers. They have the signal particles and the idler particles. The idler particles are given a longer flight path. So not only do they erase the data, but they erase the data after the first two particles, the signal particles have already done. The screen has already been imprinted. Then they erase the data. And what they find out is that when they erase the data, they don't have the which way information anymore. They get the diffraction pattern, even though they erased the data after the experiment was over.

Okay.

And  they expected that too, because that been done lots of times. Also, none of that was a surprise in the year 2000. The last time that was a surprise was probably in the 1920s.

SPEAKER_C

Thank  you.

But  it's not common knowledge, even to physicists. You're welcome. Thank.
