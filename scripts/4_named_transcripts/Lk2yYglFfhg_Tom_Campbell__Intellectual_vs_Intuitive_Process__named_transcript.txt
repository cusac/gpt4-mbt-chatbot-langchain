Hello  Tom. We are here today to discuss the intellectual process versus the intuitive process. And I know you've spoken a lot about how some of us are more left brain and some of us are more right brain and why it's important to have a balance. First, I would like you to tell us about what you mean by a balanced brain and why it is so important. And then I would like to explore remote viewing, healing, telepathic, communication and accessing the databases in a practical way that will allow people to recognize more easily when the intellect creeps in and interferes with that task that exploring through consciousness they would like to accomplish.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Okay,  well, we like to use the right brain left brain terminology. And for those of you who are a little confused at what that means, go listen to an audio clip. Actually it's a video on YouTube by Jill Taylor. If you put her name in, up will come an audio. And she was a neuroscientist who was working in this field of how the brain works and the various hemispheres and she had a chance to experience it up close and personal with a stroke. She had a stroke that basically made the left hemisphere not work. And when that happened, suddenly she was just left with a right hemisphere and she can report from a firsthand experience of how that felt. And it's a very interesting video. So I'd suggest you go look up Jill Taylor and she did a Ted Talk I believe is one of them. Or maybe it's some other video, but you'll find it, you'll find it on YouTube, maybe in several forms. Anyway, she explains how as the left brain receded and no longer functioned because it wasn't getting blood supply because of the stroke and the right brain kind of took over because the left brain wasn't doing its usual thing, the way she perceived reality and the way she perceived everything, her reality changed dramatically. So that's the context in which we are using this left brain, right brain terminology. Actually, you can probably say the left brain, right brain is a bit of a metaphor for the difference between intellect and intuitive processing. So that's how we're using it. So we in the western world, and I use that term also metaphorically because it really has nothing to do with west anymore. It's basically we in the world because western culture has pretty well dominated the world inasmuch as it is a materialism based culture based on economies, business, the degree to which people have access to the finer things in life like shelter and clean water and housing and automobiles and computers and Internet and so on. It's a very material based philosophy and it's pretty well everywhere now, except in very rural areas in very far off places that haven't yet been overrun by western ideas, cultures and economies. So anyway, in western thought, the intellect is the primary tool our mind uses the intellect and the intellect gets rewarded. If you have a fine intellect, then you'll likely get a much better job and get paid a lot more. If you are very intuitive, then people will tend to call you an airhead and they will not give you a really great job and high pay because being intuitive just isn't all that useful in this world of stuff and commerce and science and technology. It is useful, but it's useful in an indirect way, not so much in a direct way. And we tend to really miss the importance of those things that are indirect rather than direct. So in any case, what you find is that most of we in Western culture the world over are very out of balance between being intellectually dominant or being intuitively dominant, between a right brain being the intuitive and the left brain being the intellect. And that is unfortunate because both of these modes are immensely important to us. What we do, how we do it, how we see reality, how we grow, the quality of our consciousness. And the optimum position to be in is to have exercised and built up, you might say, your mental muscles in both directions. So you should be extremely right brained and extremely left brained both at the same time, which means you're good at both. You're not weak at either one. That's balance. That is a good way to be. And we undervalue this intuitive part. In fact, many of us in the Western world deny that we even have an intuitive part. They say, what intuitive part? There's no such thing as intuition. That's just one of those touchy feely things that if you have to believe in it to find it, otherwise it's not there, that is very wrong. The intuitive part is just as solid and just as real and just as scientific as the intellectual part. We just overlook it, don't pay much attention to it and ignore it. So to us, it seems almost invisible. To us. We of the west seems almost invisible. Now, other cultures, particularly if they are more primitive cultures, cultures that haven't been run over by industrialism just yet, you will find a greater appreciation for intuitive processing. They won't be so out of balance. They will be more in balance. So what is this intuitive process I'm talking about and how does it differ from the intellectual process? In the intellectual process, we value analysis, judgment, comparisons, logical processing, detailed logical processing. We go from step A to step B to step C to step D until we finally go from where we started to where it is we want to go. We go there in little what we call logical steps. In intuitive processing, you intuit the answer. You don't have to go in logical steps to get there. You just intuit the answer. The answer already exists within consciousness. We are conscious. There is this larger consciousness system of which we're a part. And this larger consciousness system has been collecting information on all of its parts, which that's us, we're a part of it. And as they say, there's not much that's new under the sun as far as people attitudes, feelings, expressions. And the system doesn't necessarily know exactly how to answer an intuitive question, perhaps. But it can answer it to a very high degree of probability to where it's very likely that it's giving you the right answer. But you still have to assess that. Now, this assessment comes from the intellect. The process of getting the information comes from the intuition. And if the two of those work real well together, then they can fill in for each other as far as when one is weak, the other is strong and vice versa. Now, the problem with the intellect being the kind of the number one boss of our thinking is that we very, very seldom have enough information to make a deductive logical choice. Deductive choice means if this, then that, if that, then this other thing. And if the other thing, then the answer. And those are all logic, deductive logic. And in deductive logic, when you get to that answer, then that answer will happen because you've looked at the path that it takes to go there. In other words, it's looking at the causality, if you will. And if that causality, if it's known, if all the information you need to know to predict the causality is known, then your deductive derivations are always going to be correct if the logic is correct and you haven't made any incorrect assumptions. But we don't have all the information. Very rarely do we have all the information. If you take something that's really trivial, the intellect can do a fair job like where are my car keys? The intellect can say, well, where were you last when you got out of your car? Oh, well, the car is in the garage and I drove it here and I haven't driven away. So the keys must be in the house someplace or in the car or somewhere in between. They're around here somewhere. So that's your analysis, but you don't know where. And that covers a lot of space, you see? And if you were to hone your intuitive side, you would say, oh, they're in the drawer in the cupboard next to the bed. You'd have the answer. You wouldn't have to logically trying to retrace your steps, if you will, you see? So that's sort of the difference. We never have enough information, even in trivial things. Well, what about big things like, well, which one of these three women that I'm dating should I marry? Oh, I'm married now, how many children should we have? And which job should I take? Should I quit this job and try to find something better or should I not? Or should I quit this boyfriend or girlfriend and try to find somebody better? Or should I not? You see, you don't have enough information to answer any of those kinds of things. Deductively. So these are the big questions. These are the questions that will change the rest of your life. Should I get a motorcycle or should I just use a cheap old Volkswagen for my transportation? Well, those will make a big difference. When it rains, when it snows, the risk that each carries. They're all very different. But how do you know what's going to work out? How do you know what's likely to happen if you make either one of those choices? You don't. So you guess. So the intellect is guessing all the time. Little bit of data make a guess. And that guess is not intuition. That guess is just guessing because the intellect doesn't have intuition. The intellect isn't intuitive. The intellect is analytical. There's another part of you that's intuitive. There's another part of your mind that does the intuitive function. So you have the analytic function we call the intellect and the intuitive function. That intellect doesn't do intuitive things, just like that intuitive function doesn't really do analysis. This is two part of your minds. They're two separate parts of your mind, and they need to work together. You see?

SPEAKER_A

Can  you distinguish? I know consciousness is at the being level, and that's our intuitive. That's what we try to tap into. Can you describe the intellect in terms of how we are avatars in a virtual reality? How does that work? There are varying degrees of intellect, and that makes a difference in people's lives as to what they can pursue, what they can do. How would you describe that and how would you attach that to who we are, the being?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Okay,  we are subsets of a larger consciousness system. So to start there with a given, if those listening to this are confused by that, then you've skipped to a more advanced discussion and you need to go back to a simpler one where we talk about who we are, how we got here, all of that basic stuff. So I'm just going to start at the top level that there is this larger consciousness system of which we are a part. We're a piece of consciousness. And we are playing an avatar in a virtual reality game called the physical universe, which is the physical universe our avatar gets around in, which is the universe that you're in now while you're sitting listening to this. It's where we live in the physical universe. So given that then this individuated unit of consciousness that is, you can function in two different ways. One, it can function intellectually and do analysis. It can judge, it can assess, it can do comparisons, does all that stuff. It can do logic. And the other part of this consciousness, another part whose processes are very different, is the intuitive part. And it's holistic. It can tap into that larger consciousness system. It can gather the information that is in that system. See, all of us, not only are we all individuated units of consciousness, but we're all netted, we all interact with each other. So all of this information, all of our thoughts, all of our ideas, all the things that we think of, whether we say them or act on them or not, they're all part of the record of us as a being. And all that information is in there, along with data and databases that are required to support the rendering of the virtual reality. One of these databases looks at the probable future. What is likely to happen in the future. Now, it's just probability. It's not that that has to happen. The system, in order to render it has to have some idea of what's likely to happen next. So it's prepared to render the things that happen next. So it keeps this database and in time, that database turns into the past as the present chugs along and consumes the future. That old future is what we call the past. So you also have a past database of all the things that could have happened and the probability that they would. And through that past database is just a little thread that wanders through that database, which actually did happen. So you have all this potentiality in the past and all this potentiality in the future. And that information is available, but only through a direct connection with consciousness. And you as an individuated unit of conscious can only access that direct connection in what we call the intuitive process. It's not an intellectual process. It's intuitive process. So in this intuitive process, you have access to all of the potential future, the probability of future states and to all of the past states. Well, that's a lot of information. That's tremendous information that is available on basically all of us. All of us. Because the computer has to feed all of us data, so it tracks all of us. And what we do think of a virtual reality game. In virtual reality game, a consciousness who we'll call the player is getting a data stream from a server that's serving the virtual reality, you see. So the player and the computer and the server in a constant dialogue and the computer constantly is sending the player information. Now, in one of our games, that information is dot, is pixels, dots on a monitor, a million dots on a monitor. And we the consciousness, we look at those dots and we interpret those dots to be that. Virtual reality rivers and streams and rocks and houses and people and whatever, we interpret those dots to be that because we have learned how to interpret the dots from birth. It's what we do. It's how we learn. It's how to interpret those dots. What does it mean? What is an apple? What is mother? And we learn how to do that. Okay? So that's the nature of the virtual reality so this consciousness now has two things that it can do. It can log on to a virtual reality game and play an avatar. Now it gets a data stream that tells the consciousness everything that the avatar senses through its five senses. What does the avatar see, smell, hear, feel? All of that. That's the data it gets. Whereas the intuitive part isn't involved in that data stream. The intuitive part is involved in connecting with the larger conscious system. It is consciousness. It's a piece of consciousness, and it can communicate and interact with consciousness. That's what it does. Well, I've simplified that probably a little too much. I'm trying to separate it so that it's easy for people to understand. But when it comes together, the consciousness that is me, both of those parts are available to me, and both of them intermix and interact. So there's a part of me that can gather data from databases, can intuitively connect with consciousness and connect with other beings, because, again, we're all netted. So that can all be done on the intuitive side. And I have all the sense data that I get, and all of that comes to me in kind of a mishmash that just makes up me. I'm all of that smeared together, if you will. But I have these two separate processors, if you like. One process is intuitive. One process is intellectual. But I get it all, and it all gets mixed together for me to make choices in this virtual reality. So I'm in the virtual reality and things happen. I have to make a choice. Do I fight or do I run? Do I go into the monster's cave, or do I go back to town? I have these choices to make, and I can make these choices based on my intellect figuring out, well, what's the probability I'm going to survive the monster's cave? Or I have to go through that monster's cave to go to my next quest, whatever. My intellect can be doing that, while my intuition can be thinking about, well, what other information could I use? How should I approach it? What is this monster like? Finding out information that the intellect doesn't have? What is this monster like?

SPEAKER_A

Would  you say that the intellect in this virtual reality is a type of constraint, just as the avatar is? So you are logging onto an avatar, and that avatar has constraints. So in terms of your virtual reality concept, just like this reality is virtual, so is the brain, if you will, of the avatar virtual. And in that sense, its consciousness must comply with the constraints that it has on that avatar as far as intellect. And then, conversely, you often talk about the LCS as being an intelligent, aware being, but there are no constraints on that intelligence as there are with us as avatars.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Well,  I wouldn't say there are no constraints. They're just different constraints. It also has its own constraints. This larger consciousness system is a finite system with a finite amount of processing power, a finite number of bits, and so on. So it has its own constraints. But in the virtual reality game, the avatar's job, what the avatar brings to the game is that it sets constraints on what the player can do with that avatar, right? So your avatar is an elf. Then the elf can't fly, but the elf maybe has spells. Or if you're a barbarian, then the barbarian may have a lot of hit points and may be a good fighter, but he's not too smart, you see? So your avatar has characteristics, and those characteristics constrain the player as to what the player can do. Well, with us, it's the same thing. Our avatars are our human bodies, and as our human bodies change, develop, gain skills, gain coordination and that sort of thing, then the avatar can do more with them. But if we get hit over the head with a stick or a metal bar and it does brain damage, and now we slur our speech and kind of limp, one leg doesn't work anymore, then that doesn't affect the consciousness. That's just an avatar adding new constraints to what the player can do with it. So now the player has to play an avatar that slurs its speech and has one leg that doesn't work, you see? Now the avatar has to play that and can only do what that can do. So our brain is, just, as you say, a virtual brain. The brain stores nothing, computes nothing, assesses nothing. The brain is just a virtual brain. There is no brain. There are no organs, if you will. None of these things really exist in, let's say, portraying you and I. So here I am. I sit here in this avatar. Now, one assumes that there's a brain in my head, one assumes there's a heart in my chest. One assumes I have livers and kidneys and stomach and all these things that are inside. But none of those have to be rendered to you in your data stream. You do not get any data describing my brain or my kidneys or my heart. You just get data describing what I look like, what's on the outside. So the computer never has to compute anything on the inside unless somebody takes a knife, like a surgeon, and cuts you open. And when they cut open the avatar, they have to see what's inside. There can't just be infinite darkness inside. There can't be nothing inside. So then, according to the rule set that defines the simulation, something will have to be inside. It'll be defined because we evolved. We evolved from what single celled things, to multicelled things, to specialized celled things, to mammals to humans. So we've gone through all that evolution. So the system knows what had to be inside in order to go through all that evolution. But it doesn't have to render it. It has to know about it. It has to know the function, and it has to know it because it has to know what constraints it poses. It has to know why it's important. So if you get somebody shoots you in the heart, well, it has to know what's inside so that it can show appropriately how that avatar would act. You see? So the system has knowledge of what would be inside if you looked. But this is a virtual reality. It's only describing what you see, not the hidden things that you don't see. And it's giving you a data stream. You get a data stream now of me sitting here on this chair talking to you, and none of my innards are in that data because they're not being measured. You only get what you measure. Your eyes and your ears are measuring me. Take that as a measurement. But if you're not measuring it, then it doesn't have to be rendered. If you're not interacting with it, it's not rendered. So the avatar sets constraints according to the rule set and according to its evolution, which is the rule set defines that evolution. It sets constraints on what the consciousness can do with that avatar. So if that avatar refuses to work with its intuition and just won't go there because, oh, that's a stupid idea. Nobody has intuition. We just guess. And when we guess right, we say, oh, well, I had a gut feeling, and that was my intuition and all of its nonsense. It doesn't really exist. So if you feel that way, then that's a constraint. You've just added a constraint on what your consciousness can do with your avatar. It can't reach any of that data. It won't reach any of that data, because that part of you that could reach that data has never been developed. It's still like it was when you were two years old. You haven't developed that intuitive part. You've only developed the intellectual part. That's if you're very dominantly left brain. So if that's the case, then it's just another set of constraints. Yes, that information is available in that intuitive part, but you can't access it because that part of you wasn't ever challenged, wasn't developed. You didn't learn how to work through the confusion and work through the issues like you did with the other part. Your intellectual part started organizing, cataloging, assessing, making facts. And it got it wrong, and it was confused, and it didn't do it very well when it was two years old and three years old, but it kept working at it and working at it. And eventually you grow up and you become an adult with a clever intellect that can make all sorts of assessments and analysis and judgments very quickly and pretty effectively. Great. You've taken one part of yourself and you've developed it. The other part of yourself is probably hanging around still around the two or three year old stage, and you've never gone through the trouble of working through the confusion, understanding what's connected to what, how things work, what the uncertainties are, why you get this kind of information, why sometimes it's wrong. All of that stuff has to get worked out. And eventually that intuitive part can become just as solid, just as reliable, just as functional and useful as that intellectual part. Actually, it's even a little more functional than that intellectual part because that intuitive side has the big picture. You see that an intellectual side has to sit over here and work intellectually up through little pictures with one step at a time. This makes that reasonable. That makes the next thing reasonable. It's got to chug its way along. Whereas the intuitive part has a much bigger picture. It sees the intellectual part, but it sees it from a much I don't know, from a much higher level, from a much more holistic level than the intellect does. So the intellect is good at slicing and dicing facts in the little picture. And the intuition at good is understanding big concepts and big ideas. And what is connected to what we might even call wisdom falls in there. In the bigger picture, seeing things from a bigger picture, how things relate and interact, all of that is more accessible to your intuitive side. Now, everybody has some intuitive side and everybody has some intellectual side. It's not a matter of you're one or the other. Everybody has both. But what happens is that some of us, instead of balancing those and developing them both, our culture tends us to develop this intellectual side like this and this intuitive side like that. So we're out of balance. We can't live up to the potential that we as human beings have. And a lot of that stuff that's on the intuitive side that the intellectual side kind of ignores falls into the woo woo side. It falls into the paranormal side. Getting information you see, that's not through this logical process is like it's not possible because it's not in this intellectual side. Therefore it can't exist. See, that's just arrogance that only sees one way and doesn't see the other.

SPEAKER_A

This  leads us to how you've explained very well how this leads us to the intellect getting in the way of our consciousness exploration. So today I would like you to give some practical examples of how people can develop their intuitive part more, as you've very well stated, the limitations of the intellect. So let's start with remote viewing, with the intuitive side.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

For  some examples, you can do things like remote viewing. That is, you can see what's going on in places other than where you are. And those places don't have to be even on this earth. They can be other places. Any place you see, they're all in the database. And if it's something that the system heavily doesn't deal with, you'll just get probabilities. What is probability like? You see, if there's nothing there that's really established facts, then you'll get probabilities. So any case, that's one remote viewing is just seeing more than what you can see.

SPEAKER_A

Good  way to find your keys.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yeah,  it's a really good way to find those keys. Right. It's in the drawer. Right. And you know that right away because you remote view where the keys are. Maybe. It depends. If you're really good at remote viewing, you can actually back out. See, if you just look aware of the keys. I want to see the keys. Well, all you get will be black. You'll just get this black box and you won't see anything. You say, well, I didn't get anything. I just got black. Well, the keys are inside a drawer, and a drawer is shut, and there isn't any light in there. That's why you're getting a black box.

SPEAKER_A

That  brings me to a good point of remote viewing, and that is the components and seeing or feeling the details of it tell us something about how that works.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

All  right. Well, when you're remote view, as I was saying, you have to understand sort of what you're doing. You're accessing data, and you get data from a database through your intent. So if you have an intent, I want to see where my car keys are. Well, like I say, you get black because where your car keys are, there isn't any light. So your query was not general enough. So you had an assumption that those car keys were laying someplace that you could see them. Well, they're not. They're in a closed drawer where you can't see them. So you fail to get an answer because you don't realize that no answer is the right answer. You cannot see them. They're not someplace that you can see. But if you practice, you can get to the point where you can say, well, I didn't see that. So let me back out and see it from a bigger picture. I'd like to see those keys where those keys are, even if the keys are hidden, I'd like to see where they're hidden, where the black space is. Well, now you may see a chest of drawers with the drawers shut, and you can say, oh, that looks like my dresser next to my side of the bed, and you recognize it. And now you go look in those drawers and you find your keys. But if you didn't know to back out like that, you just say it didn't work. See, this is what I mean when I say you have to practice. You have to understand what you're doing your whole life now, you've been practicing your intellect. You've been learning what works and what doesn't and how you approach things. And one approach is better for this and other approaches are better for that. And you're learning all of this stuff. And then your intuitive side, you've done nothing. You have not practiced with that at all. So you. Find it all very confusing, very haphazard. You can't seem to control it. It sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. And it's just kind of strange, goofy stuff. And that's because you've never learned to develop it. So, yes, it's going to be problematical. It's not going to be easy. If you'd never developed your intellectual side and somebody said something that required a little intellect, you kind of would act like you were retarded. You wouldn't know because if you hadn't practiced your intellectual side, it would be everything would be I don't know, because you would not have learned how to do analysis and different kinds of analysis that you do, and how do you extrapolate your analysis and all of that that's become automatic. Wouldn't be automatic if you hadn't spent years and years honing it. So on this intuitive side, where you spent almost no time at all honing it. Well, if you're left brain, if you're right brain, you spent time honing that intuitive side. So you are good at that. And probably like most right brains in our culture, your left brain has not been exercised much, and you're not very good at the logical process. We tend to go one way or the other. So what you do then is you start looking for other details, other things that will help you, say, describe your target that you're remote viewing. So the way that a beginner will succeed more easily is to break these things down into pieces. Okay? And if you were looking for your car keys, well, you've already seen something black, and that didn't help. So you might think, well, you might want to break that down into other things. Well, the place where they are, does it have an odor? Does it have space? How much space? Or is it tight? Is it cramped or is it spacious? You might want to ask, does it have a particular odor? Maybe your drawers are lined in cedar, and you'd oh, that smells like cedar. You see, you'd get that. And what is the ambience there? Well, you can do this with almost anything. Is it sad? Is it yellow or blue? What are the colors? What are the feelings? What are all the sense data? What do you hear? What do you see? What do you feel? A lot of it is in feeling space, what's the ambience of the place? So you can get all this information, and then that will help you define what it is. Whereas if you just look and say, well, all right, there's a picture in this box. What's the picture? Well, you have to be a really good remote viewer just to give them the picture. But if you're learning and you want to make it easier for yourself, then you have to get all the nuances, all the different pieces of that picture. Is it a happy picture? Is it about people? Is everybody having fun? What do you hear? Oh, I hear noises like people laughing and clapping their hands, like it's maybe a party or at a performance someplace. And let's see, is there a smell? Yeah, I smell popcorn. And you do all this stuff, and now it'll be a bunch of people sitting in a movie theater or something, you see. But to just get people in a movie theater, you would have to write out of no context whatsoever, put that together in your intellect, and your intellect is not really playing here. Your intellect doesn't have any data to work on, so your intellect comes up empty handed. You have to get this through the intuitive side. So our problem that we have, say, remote viewing, just as an example, the problem we have is that that intellect is so dominant that as soon as the intuition starts to gather some data, the intellect will jump in and try to analyze that data and name it and name it and say, what is it? Okay, what is that? What's in the box? And you'll look at the box, and the first thing you'll say is, well, it's kind of roundish and smells good, like sort of a pastry shop. And right away, oh, it's donuts, oh, it's whatever. And you'll make stuff up. And that's the intellect getting in front. When we use our telepathic skills, we all have telepathic skills. We're all connected to other people, and if we develop those telepathic skills, we can communicate with them. So when you're working your telepathic skills and you just ask, like, well, I'd like to talk to Joe. Hey, Joe, are you out there? And you hear Joe say, yeah, I'm here. What do you want? The intellect immediately jumps in and says, oh, what was that? Did I just make that up? All right, I was talking to Joe. I guess I just made up that he know your intellect gets in front and wants to analyze the data you got, because that's what it does. And as soon as it does that, you're no longer connected to that data stream through your intuition. So remote viewers have found some things to get around that to keep their intellect out of it. One thing they do is they try to remove all information from the subject, say there's something in a box. Well, even that gives them some information, because if they see the box, they know it say, the box isn't any bigger than this, by this, by that, okay, now, it's got to be something about that size. So the intellect is already analyzing what could possibly be in the box. So it's not going to be a horse, because a horse is too big. Wrong. It might be a little tiny statue of a horse, you see, but your intellect will say, horse way too big for the box. You see, the intellect gets in the way. It's a problem. So we have remote viewers saying, well, look, we got to get rid of the information. And the way they tend to work is triple blind. They'll have one person, person A. And these people don't know each other, right? They don't interact with each other. So Person A all by themselves gets together 10,000 photographs that have clear elements to them. A photograph of just a cloud of fog isn't useful because there's nothing really there. So they have stuff in them that you could see. And so they got their 10,000 photographs together from whatever source and they take each photograph and they put it in an envelope. So they just randomly put it in an envelope. And now when they're done, they give those envelopes to somebody else. Well, somebody else takes those envelopes, stirs them all around and numbers them 12345, that kind of thing. All right? So now they're number one to 10,000 envelopes. Now the remote viewer or the person who's implementing the remote viewing, he asks for a target to remote view. At that point you do a random selection of a number between one and 10,000. And you just do that in a computer that has a random number selector and it'll go from one to 10,000. And you push a button, up comes a number, number 1257. Now that corresponds to some envelope that has some picture in it. Now that person takes that 1257. That's the number that you get, right? Random number. And it puts that random number into an envelope, another envelope. So now you get an envelope with a little card in it that says 1257 and it hands it to the next guy. And the next guy takes that envelope, walks over to the remote viewer and says, I've got a number in here that corresponds to a picture. Tell me what the picture is about. He never opens the envelope. He never tells him what the number is. He just says, I've got a number in this envelope that corresponds to a picture. Describe the picture for me. You see, that's triple blind. Nobody knows what the other people did before. It's randomly drawn out of one to 10,000 pictures. And though the pictures aren't all the same, it's not a picture of rubber Duck. And then the guy knows he ought to say Rubber Duck because he's going to be right. All 10,000 of them are rubber ducks. It's not like that. The first guy was meant to put pictures all different kinds of pictures of all different kinds of things. All of them should be as unique as possible, have unique elements in it. And those elements could be color or shape or landscape or still life or people or children or adults. I mean, there's just lots of things you can pick from and dogs and cats and horses and all sorts of things. So you get all these pictures and we're triple blind here. The remote viewer doesn't have anything for his intellect to work on. Nothing. And that makes it easier for him not harder, you see? And of course, they use that, and they say, well, look, this is really good science because we're triple blind here. And it is good science, but it also makes it easier for the remote viewer to get it right, because now he's disengaged his intellect, because the intellect has zero data. See, that's the way remote viewers prefer to work. Triple bind is easier than if somebody says there's something in a box and you know that it's got to fit in the box already. Your intellect has some information. And if the guy doing it is a guy who's really into gardening, you know, he's a professional gardener, then you may think there's trowels in there, or maybe there's a flower pot, or maybe there's a picture of the giant watermelon that he grew or something. And you'll start guessing about things that you know about him and what he might have come up with to put in the box. And that intellect is relentless. It just keeps working on whatever information it has, and then it guesses. And the guesses are almost always wrong. You see that's almost always wrong. The intellect doesn't have any connection to this database. It's a different part of the consciousness.

SPEAKER_A

First  thing that comes to your mind, the right thing, the first impressions.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yeah,  that's true. And all those other things we talked about. So, yes, it is the first impression that comes because you're querying a database. When you query a database, the database sends you an answer. And that database is very fast. It's a very fast database. So another mistake that people make is they say, well, okay, query the database. I'd like to know what's show me a picture of what's in there, or, I want to get something about what's in that box. Now you get yourself ready, and you relax, and, okay, you're ready. Well, it's already done within a 10th of a second of you saying, I want to see a picture. It was there. And you're still jabbering on about relaxing and doing something else and wanting it. You miss it. It comes immediately. This is just like any other database query. And if your database query is real general, if you say, okay, what's in the box? And you didn't specify what box, you get a random draw from anything. It could be a box anywhere, because all you said is, what's in the box? Terrible query. You see, what's in that box is important. It doesn't guess for you. It doesn't add in stuff to what you ask for. It just gives you what you ask for. So if the guy doing the remote viewing testing has five boxes, and every time you in your mind say, okay, well, I want to know, if you just ask in that situation what's in his box or what's in that box? But you don't really say what you're talking about, and in your mind, it's not clear. Your mind is kind of fuzzy exactly what you're doing and so on. If your language is fuzzy, then and many people do this, you might get all five things correct, but you may get them in the wrong order because you didn't specify. You maybe specifies that I want his box, the boxes that this guy's bringing. But then when you ask for it, you just say what's in the box? And okay, it's the box that these guys brought and that's in your mind, but that particular box isn't in your mind. So as you go through them and get one, then the next time it's only between four boxes and the next time between three and next time, the last one is the one that's left. So you may get all five items perfectly right, but you may get them all in the wrong order because your query was not specific other than to say, that guy's boxes. I mean, you intended it somewhere in there, but you weren't clear. And so the other thing that we need to talk about here is not only do you need to be very clear and precise like you do with any query, but instead of going for what's in the box, if you're a very skilled remote viewer, you might do that and it might work just fine. But if you want to make it easier for yourself and more likely that you're going to get parts of it right, you'll say, well, what's in the box? What's the texture of what's in the box? Is it a tool? Is it some kind of tool or something you use to work with in the box? What's the color of the thing in the box? What are the architectural elements? What does it look like? So what does it look like? Isn't the only thing. There's other things there you can work with. What's the surroundings? What are the feelings with that thing? See, it might be a party hat in the box or one of those little things that you blow at and it makes a whistle and the thing rolls out. It may be something like that and then you may hear like a party going on and a lot of children giggling or something. You might get that and you'd say, well, it seems like a happy kind of party atmosphere. Well it might be a party hat or it might be something that would be associated with that. So you get the feelings, you get colors, you get all your sense data, smell, taste and feeling stuff, size, shapes. You get all of this, what's it used for, and if you can get all those and write them down and then as you look at it, they may not make any sense to you at all. But then when you see what the target is, you may find out that a whole lot of the things that you got there were right on. It was like that. So you never came up with party hat, but you came up party children laughing. You may have come up with it's multicolored speckles, and sure enough, the party hat's red, blue, green, pink, little balls on it or something, little round things on it. So you may have said that, well, it was speckled and you may have said any number of things, and if you get almost all that right, but you never actually said it's a red, blue, green, speckled party hat, then you still get a lot of credit for getting information about what was in the box. So it's not about naming the thing in the box, it's about gathering information about the thing in the box. The intellect wants to just name it. What is it? I don't get anything or, oh, I got a party hat. That's ridiculous. It's not likely to party hat. I just went to a birthday party last week with my kids and that's why I thought that and you make all these excuses up, so then you go on and say, no, that wasn't you throw it away. And that throwing away isn't necessarily a long thing. You may do that in milliseconds to where you threw it away and your intellect is not even necessarily where that you got it, processed it and went on because you decided it was useless. Therefore, it never even gets sent to your intellect to process. So it's a problem. Your intellect will just jump in the way of what you're doing. Now, here's an interesting thing about the intellect and the intuitive level, and that is when you dream, you only dream if it's not a lucid dream. If it's a regular dream, then that dream, you make choices in that dream from your intuitive side. And I often call that your being level. It's what you are. It's the core of you that defines you, whereas your intellect often is your image, who you think you are, what you think you are, what you'd like to be. That's what you have in your intellect, because your intellect tends to have a lot of ego and beliefs in it, whereas your core of you is just what you are. So when you have normal dreams, all the choices you make in those dreams are you. They're right out of your being level, right out of your intuitive part. So that's interesting. Now, if you have a lucid dream, now, your intellect gets involved and starts analyzing and judging and doing other things, and that's different than a normal dream. So we do use this intuitive side all the time, like in dreaming, but we also use it in what we call hunches. And I got a gut feeling and I'm getting good vibes or bad vibes from that person. Wow, I've only met this person for ten minutes and I just really like them. They're just really great person, or, I've just met this person for two or three minutes and I really just don't like them. But there's no reason for it. They haven't said anything bad or wrong or anything or whatever. I just for some reason don't like them or I do like them. And we call that getting good vibes or bad vibes. But that's new age talking, it has nothing to do with vibes, it just has to do with you're getting information on your intuitive side. But if you haven't developed it, you don't pay much attention to it. You go oh that'silly and you go on anyway, you don't pay attention to it. Then often later, when it turns out they really were a nice person, or not so nice, you say oh, I should have taken that first impression, that really was the right one and then I messed up. You often in arrears realize that your intuition is giving you the right information, but not when it gives you the information. Usually that only happens later. And it's not the same as a gut level guess. That's what your intellect does. It's well, the intellect says I've got this feeling it's probably this, could be that, but I'll go with this, that seems more right. That's just your intellect taking a guess. And that's often done out of the intellect, not done out of the intuition at all. Don't call that your intuition and claim that your intuition isn't very reliable. Because mostly that's your intellect sometimes get confused.

SPEAKER_A

And  how can we develop a way to recognize more when that intellect jumps in?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Well,  it's very difficult because if you are a left brain dominant person, using that intellect is how you run your life, it's how you live, it's how you do everything. And if that's the case, then one you probably don't even know you have an intuitive side, you wouldn't recognize it if it bit you, you won't recognize it. So in that case, it's almost impossible for you to tell, because everything you do is intellectual. And if it's not, you either downplay it, dismiss it, or make excuses for it, or something else. You don't really pay any attention to it. So in that case, trying to show you what's the difference would be almost impossible because you don't even accept that it's there, or that it can be reliable, or it can be something that you can learn how to do with practice, get better at to where it's a very reliable tool that you can use. So people get confused by that. But here's a couple of examples of things that take place at the being level. And it's an interesting fact that anything we do, anything that's a doing thing that is complex, that requires maybe multiple steps, or requires precision, or requires very, I don't know, very kind of trained responses. Mostly we're only good at them if we do them at the being level because the intellect is always second guessing. The intellect is always trying to tell you what to do you see, always judging and assessing. So for an instance, touch typing, when you learn to touch type, it means you don't look at where your fingers are. And it's not just that you memorize where the keys are. Eventually, you have to get out of your intellect. Your intellect says, okay, the T is up right with that finger. The X is down here with that finger. And you kind of mechanically, one at a time, you're reading, what is it, that old thing, the brown dog jumps over some kind of dog jumps over the brown fox or has all the letters of the alphabet in it. And when you learn to type, you type that the lazy brown dog jumped over the something fox. Anyhow, if you're looking at each word and then figuring out where you need to put your finger, that's your intellect trying to solve the problem for you. But you'll never be good at typing if you work through your intellect. When you get to the point where you stop trying to figure out which finger should hit which key, and you just let the fingers hit the keys that they know where to hit. Now, you can be a good typist. That's called touch typing, where you just so you go like 60 words a minute or something, rather than five or ten, which is your limit if you're looking for the key. Let's see, next is an E. There it is, punk. The next is a z. There it is. You're a very slow typer doing that, and you tend to type with two fingers doing that because you have to look for the key and punch it. It's a deliberate thing to reach for a particular key and hit it rather than let your fingers just go where they know to go. That's done at the bean level. That's intuitive. Your fingers intuitively know where to go and what to do. That's true of anything if you're an athlete, athletes will tell you, I mean, a really good athlete, somebody who's maybe Olympics quality athlete, somebody who's excelled, if you're a really good athlete, they'll tell you that 80% of winning is mental. And that's because you have to get out of your intellect into your intuition. If you're there in the field doing whatever, oh, okay, let's see. You hold the javelin right about here. Now, you put your arm back like this, the front foot forward, and you take two, three steps, and you throw it. And if your intellect's telling you how to do that, you'll be a miserable javelin thrower. You have to do it to the point that you just do it intuitively, like the typing. You just do your thing, steps, you throw it. And it's true with anything. Yes, playing a guitar, playing the piano, initially, your intellect tells you, here's middle C. Here's the other things and every note. You have to figure out where your hand goes. But eventually you just read the music, and the hands go over where they need to go or the guitar. That just happens. You don't do that with your intellect. I had a painter in my house, and the painter was a really good painter, and he would do the little woodwork between window glass. You had a bunch of window panes with little woodwork between them, and he'd go and he'd dip his paint. He'd reach up there, and he'd make a stroke like that. And when he did, there wasn't a single molecule of wood that didn't have paint on it, and there wasn't a single molecule of glass that did have paint on it. He was perfect. He just put paint where he wanted paint and didn't get any anywhere else. And I was just amazed that he could do this. And if he had used his intellect, it would have been, oh, I'm getting a little close there. Better move back. Missed a spot there. Better go up. And he'd be second guessing himself, analyzing what he was doing, and he would have made a mess. He would have had paint all over the window. Painters like that use tape because that way, if they're sloppy, it pulls off with the tape. Painters who are really good save that step. They don't need tape. They can just paint it and do it perfectly one stroke after the next, after the next. And if you ask them how they do it, you realize that they get in what's called the zone. They're in the zone. Just like that javelin thrower. Can't throw that javelin unless his mind is in the right space. And it's not an intellectual space. It's in a space of the result of success, of just doing it, and you know you've done it well when it feels right, not when your intellect has decided that you made all the right moves, but when it really feels right, it's a feeling you've done it right. Well. That's the painters in the zone. The athlete has to get in the zone. That's why when an athlete gets out to go, he's not talking on his cell phone, selling stocks and talking to these kids and then closes the cell phone, grabs these giant, and throws it. That won't work. He's got to get his head into the right mind space, where he's out of the intellect, into the intuitive side. You have to stay focused in that space, get in the zone and stay. So anything athletics, no matter what you're doing, you have to be able to get out of your intellect and do it well. And I say anything. I mean anything complex, anything has a lot of parts in it, because your intellect cannot correlate a lot of parts very quickly. Your intellect isn't that quick, but intuitively, you can correlate all those parts perfectly. It's a matter of what do they call muscle memory if you're an athlete? But it's not just muscle memory. It is an intuitive space. You can have all the muscle memory because you've practiced for thousands of hours and get up there and have a terrible day. That terrible day is because your mind wasn't in the right place. So this intuitive side is really very powerful. It can do all kinds of things your intellect can't do. It puts you in the zone for all sorts of things. When you're solving a problem, you're a mathematician and you're solving a problem. Mathematics is very logical. That's a logical process. That's left brain work, that's intellectual work, and you're working down here, and you get to a point that just don't see the next step. Well, you can push at it and push at it, and you just don't see the next step. And then you take a deep breath and you kind of close your eyes and you just kind of let the problem go and there's the next step. You see? So even technical people who are very left brain use their intuition all the time. It's where art is all done at an intuitive level. Art that's done at an intellectual level isn't really art. It's just technique. Art has to be done at the intuitive level, where it doesn't say anything to you. It isn't good that art is playing that saxophone or whatever. He's not thinking where his fingers ought to go. He's just expressing his feelings through his instrument. It's all intuitive driven. So see, we say, oh, that intuition. There really isn't any intuition and it's not there. All the art comes out of the intuition. Most of the big scientific breakthroughs, the AHAs, all come out of the intuition. They all happen when you're not really pushing on it with your intellect. You're relaxed, you're open. But in your mind, because you've been working on it, you have the question, how does that work? What's that next step? But you're not trying to push it. You just have that in your mind and you're relaxed and poof. There's the answer. You see, a lot of the novelists get their plots and their stories intuitively. They're not intellectually doing all of that. A lot of it's an intuitive process. Intellectually, they have to make coherent sentences that have all the verbs and nouns and everything else in the right place, in the right tense, at the right time. But that's the mechanics of it. The creative part of it is mostly intuitive what feels right, what feels good. And that's true of everything we do. So if we really discount that intuitive part, we'd be uncoordinated slobs who couldn't think up anything new. You see, that intuitive part is really important to us, but yet we never take the time to develop it, to hone it, to understand how it works, to make it reliable. But we use it all the time, whether we're a doctor, a lawyer, an Indian chief, a mathematician, or whatever. We get that kind of spark of knowledge. Of inspiration that just comes in a lump from our intuition. And the same way it is about people. If we interact with people, your intuition tells you about that person and what they're feeling and what they're thinking and the kind of person there is that comes right to you.

SPEAKER_A

What  would you say is the best way to help someone more left brain develop their intuition?

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Well,  there's lots of ways. And one of the good ways of the ways we just talked about is remote viewing. You can take there's lots of things you can do, but one, let's say, is remote viewing. You can go to Google and put in remote viewing targets and you'll come up with five or six free target sites on the internet that will simply give you a number and then you go remote view what that number relates to some picture, just like we said. And then after you've written down what it smelled like, what it felt like, what color it was, how did it feel, what did it look like. And once you've put all that stuff down, then you go up and type that number into that site and up comes your picture. And now you can look at your picture and look at what you drew and what you wrote down and see whether you get immediate feedback, whether you got any of it right or none of it right. And if you do that, and let's say the first couple of times your intellect is going to jump in and mess it up, you're probably not going to do very well. Occasionally you'll startle yourself and you'll say, wow, I nailed that one. Well then's when you say, well, what did I do differently? And what will come to you is, well I didn't really try, I gave up and said I'm no good at this, who cares? I'll do another one. And you just weren't trying. That's the one you get right because your intellect wasn't in there trying to solve the problem. So eventually, if you go through hundreds of these, you'll find what works, what doesn't, the state you need to be in, how you have to approach it, and so on. And eventually you can help train your intuitive level to remote view, you see. Now I knew a guy that was a course I was taking and this was an intuition developing course and he had, I think it was five cups, just plastic drinking cups like you could buy at any grocery store. And one was yellow, one was green, one was blue, one was red. And I think he might even had an orange. And he had these cups and he had matching balls. They were balls, sort of like tennis balls, but just about that size but small. And they were the same colors, yellow, red, blue, green, orange, all that stuff. And what he did is that he put a mask on one of those sleep masks that no light can get through, not just a bandana over his eyes that's too easy to look around it, but a big one. It goes all the way from the top of your forehead, all the way down around your nose, and it's perfectly blacked out with soft foam rubber around it. We put on a mask like that. And then he had somebody hand him a ball. And actually he put the cups out in front of himself. But then after he put his mask on, somebody else took the cups and rearranged them, shuffled them all around, so he didn't have any visual information about what color was where. Then they'd hand him a ball, he would take the ball and drop that colored ball into the cup of the same color. And this guy had done this obviously for a long time. He was one of the teachers in this course how to develop Your intuition. And you could hand him the balls, and as fast as you could hand them to him, he could put them in the right cup. So he'd sit there and he'd give him a ball and he'd plop you give him the green one in the green cup, giving the red one the red cup, and he'd do it just that quick. The ball would hit his hand, he'd just stick it in the right cup. And I asked him, I said, how do you know which cup to put it in? Because he knew there were five cups and they were all in a line right in front of him. And he said, well, I don't know. She says, I have no idea what cup to put it in. But my hand knows, my arm knows. I just let it go to wherever it needs to go, just like typing. I don't think where all those letters and keys are. My hand just goes intuitively where it needs to go when I'm reading what it is I'm supposed to type up here on a screen. You don't think about it. It's just intuition. You get into the zone. And I watched him do like ten balls. One he was just demonstrating after another. Ten balls all in a row, all took him about a half a second to stick them in a cup. And he got everyone right. And he wasn't using his intellect to say, well, I just put in the yellow, green and red, so the next one's probably blue. He wasn't doing that because once he put it in a cup, you take the ball out and you could give him that blue, or if you had enough blue balls, you could give him that blue like four times in a row. It didn't matter. It wasn't that his intellect was not assessing. He just let his arm and hand go to wherever it needed to go. And it knew it's a little different than the typing, because in the typing, those keys don't move around. Nobody shuffles the keyboard. But this is a little harder. That's a simpler thing to do because the keys stay where they are. Maybe if you let him put his cups of a certain color at a certain place so he knew where those colored cups were all the time, maybe that would be sort of more like typing. But still it's an exercise that you can do. And if you give up trying to guess and just put it where it seems like it goes, and then feel the difference between when it works and when it doesn't, do more of that and less of the other, more of what works, less of what doesn't work. And in time, you will begin to develop your intuition to a tool that is reliable, that you can depend on. It's not a flaky thing that sometimes work and sometimes doesn't. You're the flaky one that sometimes can get into the right mind state, and sometimes you can't. But when you are in that right state, when you do have your intellect quiet, it just works. Now, let's say you're disturbed, you've had a bad day at work, you and your significant other just got in a fight. Well, now, you may not be very good at it, you see, you may just do it all wrong, whereas before you could do it because you're not able to quiet your mind, focus, get into that intuitive state. Your mind keeps jumping around because you got too much going on in your life just then. And you got a lot of emotional stuff going on. And that emotional stuff losing your being level, and it's getting in the way, you see? So sometimes you may not be able to do it because you can't get your intellect to sit down and be quiet. But if you can, then it'll work very, very well. So the variable isn't that your intuition is flaky. It's that you are flaky. You're the one that comes to it in different mindsets and different moods with different attitudes all the time. And that's what makes it problematical and that, well, sometimes I just can't do it. Well, it's not that your intuition is problematical, that you are problematical. If you can learn to get past that, or even if you do have a lot of things going on in your life, you still can drop into that intuitive state. And then it'll work all the time because you've learned how to cultivate that state and be in it and stay in it. So that's what it takes. So we did remote viewing. You can diagnose people, oh, so and so has problems with their stomach. And that's just a query to a database. What's wrong with so and so? Well, if you're expecting somebody to tell you, oh, it's her stomach, that's a lot harder. It's easier to get a visual. So you picture a humanoid thing and say, everything that's white is healthy, and anything that's wrong I want to see is dark. And then say, now what's wrong with Susie Q? And this little gingerbread cookie humanoid outline represents Susie Q. And you have those intents in your mind, then what you'll see is a dark spot right there at the stomach. And you'll say, oh, okay, she has some kind of problem with her stomach. And again, you can make your queries better. You can be more specific if you get a little more developed at it. You can zoom in and look at individual cells if you know what you're looking for, or zoom back out, because all of this is just asking for different levels of detail of information. That's all in the databases. So you can ask for the information on a molecular level if you want, or a cellular level, or just a big gingerbread cookie top level. And you can get information of any sorts. And you don't have to have pictures. You can have graphs. You can say, okay, here's health on this axis and here's time on that axis. Zero is dead, 100 is 100%. And I want to see how this health is going to change from now till ten years from now, one year at a time, ten clicks over and watch the graph. The graph will just sit there and draw itself. And now you can get your data. You get to specify the output format in this query. That'd be nice with Google if Google do that, but Google doesn't do that. They've only got one output format. And that's type they're going to send you to give you a little information, right, that's on your screen. That's what they're going to give you. Now, it may have a URL in it, it may have other things in it, but they're just going to give you stuff, information that's in words. But this you can ask for if you're asking simple questions, you can ask for colors if it's a yes, no, or maybe you can say yes is green, no is red, and maybe is orange. So now it's an output format.

SPEAKER_A

Well,  these are a lot of good examples of how you can develop your intuition. And it can be applied to any of these so called paranormal things which are really more fundamental to us than.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Communicating  with other people. Is one what we said that the remote viewing is one getting data out of a database not only about somebody's health, but about somebody's emotional state, somebody's spiritual state, whatever. If you can define it in your mind of what you mean, then there's information that you can get on that. So, yes, all of those things that we leave any out of communication, we're all netted. You can communicate with beings, and these are beings that are alive and playing the game here, or there are beings that have been here and are dead now here and someplace else, when they're already dead here, then what you're communicating with is the data in the database about them while they were here. You see? So all of these things are available to a well developed and well practiced intuition. But you don't get this quickly. You're not like in two weeks going to have a really well developed how long did it take you to get your intellect to the point that it is where it is today? Years? Decades? You had to learn the basics. You needed a lot of experience. You learned from the experience. It's the same way in the intuitive side. It's not a quick learn, but it's a very valuable learn. Because what you'll find is that the two, the intellect and the intuition work perfectly together, where one fills in what the other doesn't understand and you become a whole person. So you're getting all the data. The intellect is analyzing and sorting the data and the intuition is gathering data and the intellect takes that data and the data that it sees in its own experience pulls it all together and you come out with a result. So your result is from all of your capability as consciousness. Not just from a piece of it, it's from all of it. And you don't have to really work at the integration or anything else that all just automatically takes place because you have an intent for a result. And it's a shame that we ignore a very important, a very reliable, a very precise set of information because we discount it. It's not physical. You see. This intuition is not a physical thing. When that javelin thrower feels just right and that painter is in the Zone, that's not a physical thing. You can't measure in the Zone, whether you're an athlete or a painter or a touch typist. You don't measure in the Zone. It's a nonmeasurable, it's a mental state. Mental states aren't things we measure. Those are not objective things. They're subjective things. So you've got the objective world and that's part of it. You've got the subjective world and that's another part of it. But yes, that subjective world also has a science. There's a science there. There's structure, there's logic, there's the way things work and the way things don't work. You just have to learn it just like you did over here on the other side, on the intellectual side. So it's really expanding and life changing. When you have both of these data streams coming, interacting and reorganizing themselves around the value that each one brings to it. That then is when you are kind of a whole person and not just part of the person, not just an intellect. If you're just an intellect, we say that you live your life out of your head and that's very limited life. You tend to suppress your emotions and your feelings because those emotions and feelings are not objective, therefore they're not dependable, can't be measured. They don't really exist. They're illusions, you see? So you tend to be more robot like, more Spock like. Spock Kirk was the one that had feelings and intuition, and Spock just had logic. And Spock was very clever and very fast, but he was limited. And it was Captain Kirk who, know, saved everybody's bacon at the end because he had more than logic. He had logic, and he had Spock to help him with that logic. But he also had intuition that was based on other things besides just the logic. And that's the reason they succeeded in most of their adventures, was because both of those things together, working as a team, are really very powerful. And you can have that in yourself. Otherwise, if you're very, very left brain, you don't get relationships. You have trouble with relationships because relationships are mostly in the intuitive space. The intuitive space is feeling space. You feel things. When you get that data in a remote viewing, you feel that ambience. You feel that party atmosphere for the party hat. You feel things, you see. It feels red and blue and green. This ball feels like it belongs over there. It's in a feeling space. It's not the same as an intellectual space. It's not that something in your intuition says, move your hand up, move it out, move it over, stop, open your hand. It's not that's not what's going on. It's this feels right, and it is right. So you have to get into feeling spaces. Well, if you live out of your head and your left brain, you don't really have feeling spaces much. Oh, you have them, but they're all just a blurry gummy wad of stuff that you can't differentiate, and they're very hard to use. And you have feelings, yes, but you tend to suppress them. You don't work with them and develop them to the point that you can say, well, it feels right to drop that ball here. So feeling space, you see, and to be a feeling person who can use feelings, like where to drop the ball, is a person who's a lot more plugged in in relationships. Relationships take place in feeling space, not in intellectual space. So if you have trouble with relationships, it's because you're probably too left brain. Logical process is the way you do things. But relationships aren't about logic. They're about feelings, you see? So we talk about that intuitive space. Yeah, who needs it? It's unreliable. Probably doesn't even exist. The only thing that's real is this objective, logical stuff. That's like rejecting the most important part of your life. You say, the only thing that's important in life is the stuff. Well, nobody feels like that. The things that are most important in your life are not the stuff. It's everything else. It's relationship, it's caring. It's everything else. That's what's important in life. It's the feeling. It's how happy are you? How satisfied are you? How much peace do you carry into the world as opposed to how upset are you? How angry are you? How annoyed are you that other people just don't get it? You have all this self centered stuff, but that feeling space opens up another whole world to you, and that's the space of your intuition. So all of that goes together. If you're too left brain, you live out of your head and you're missing the important part of your life. If you're all right brained, you get the feeling space. You're getting all the data, but you don't really understand why you're getting it, how you get it. All you know is that you think and feel certain ways and you get information, and nobody pays much attention to you because you can't explain it. I don't know how I get it. It just happens. I just do. And the left brainers look at people like that and brush them off as airheads, you see, because they can't explain what they get. Whereas if you have both the intellect and the intuition, you can explain it because there is a science and logic and structure to the intuitive world. You just have to develop it and build it. And then you will know how you get that information and why you get it. You have to know about databases and queries and how to query and how not to query and how to keep your intellect sitting down and being quiet. And you know how you get the data. Well, I get that because that's the data in the database. That's a probable future. That probable future right now is sitting at about 0.7. You can get that. So I encourage everyone to develop their intuitive side, to develop their feeling side. That is what gives your life richness. That's what gives your life meaning. That's where the peace and the happiness comes from. That's where the satisfaction comes from. Those are all feelings that come out of that feeling space. Otherwise, you're the robot intellectual who thinks his way through everything. And though he's very clever, there's something missing in his life. He's just not really connecting with people or with relationships. It's a shallow existence.

SPEAKER_A

Thank  you, Tom. This is a good argument and good examples of how a balanced brain can bring you a richer life.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

But  it's not a balanced brain. It's a balanced consciousness, balanced conscious. That brain has really nothing to do with it. It's a virtual brain. It's a balanced consciousness can lead to a very rewarding life. And without that balance, you are one dimensional and one dimensional. People are really good at solving logical problems, but they're not very good at living a life. They're not very good at relationship. They're not very good at finding happiness and finding satisfaction in their life. Their satisfaction is always solving the next problem, doing clever things. But that doesn't leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling that a good relationship leaves you with, or that fulfillment. It's all kind of sterile compared to the feeling side. So yeah, it's not a brain. We call left brain, right brain. But I said we're using that as a metaphor. Of course, those are metaphors for certain things that consciousness can do. It's not really about right brains and left brains. Brains are irrelevant. We're talking about consciousness and that right brain. Left brain is a metaphor for two different ways of approaching processing information and ways of kind of opening yourself up to all the information, not just one side of it or one slice of it.

SPEAKER_A

Here's  to a balanced consciousness.

XXXTom CampbellXXX

Yes.

SPEAKER_A

Thank  you, Tom.
