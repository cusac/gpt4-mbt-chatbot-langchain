    "SPEAKER_B": {
        "summary": "Explains that the answer to whether there is real communication with the deceased and a real afterlife depends on how one defines those terms. Discusses the difference between identifying as an avatar versus identifying as consciousness, and how that affects the concept of an afterlife. Describes how consciousness survives the death of the avatar and how the larger conscious system can limit itself to the set of experience of the dead person for the benefit of the living avatars. Compares the limited afterlife of identifying as an avatar to the afterlife of identifying as consciousness and the potential for growth and learning in the latter. Discusses the limitations of carrying on as an avatar and the difficulty of changing oneself due to the limitations of one's experiences. Questions the efficiency and practicality of a virtual reality where dead avatars interact with each other and explores the potential nature of such a reality."
